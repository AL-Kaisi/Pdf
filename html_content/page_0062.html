                    <h2>Antineoplastic Agents Strategies for Design [استراتيجيات تصميم الأدوية]</h2>

<p>#<h2>Key Concepts</h2></p>

<ul><br><li><strong>Antineoplastic agents</strong>: Drugs used to treat cancer, which inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis.</li><br><li><strong>5-fluorouracil (5-FU)</strong>: A pyrimidine analogue that inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) and is a key component of various antineoplastic regimens.</li><br><li><strong>Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase</strong>: An enzyme responsible for the catabolic inactivation of 5-FU, which reduces its efficacy.</li><br></ul>

<p>#<h2>Summary</h2></p>

<ul><br><li>The mechanism of inhibition of TS by 5-fluorouracil involves binding to the enzyme's active site, preventing it from synthesizing thymidylate.</li><br><li>Catabolic inactivation of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase reduces its efficacy and eliminates its anticancer effects.</li><br><li>Metabolic activation of capecitabine to 5-FU is essential for its therapeutic activity.</li><br></ul>

<p>#<h2>Important Information</h2></p>

<ul><br><li>Key fact: The effectiveness of antineoplastic agents like 5-fluorouracil relies on their ability to target specific cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal tissues.</li><br></ul><br><li>Key fact: Understanding the mechanisms of action and metabolism of these drugs is crucial for optimizing treatment regimens and improving patient outcomes.</li>
