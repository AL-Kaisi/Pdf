                    <h2>Cancer Biology: Cell Cycle and Oncogenes</h2><br>#<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

<ul><br><li><strong>Cancer cells</strong>: Cells that have acquired the ability to proliferate uncontrollably due to genetic mutations or alterations.</li><br><li><strong>Cell cycle</strong>: The process of cell division, consisting of G1, S, G2, and M phases, driven by proteins called cyclins and their associated CDKs.</li><br><li><strong>Oncogenes</strong>: Genes that are responsible for the development of cancer when mutated or altered. Proto-oncogenes can transform into oncogenes through mutations or translocations.</li><br><li><strong>Tumor suppressor genes</strong>: Genes that regulate cell division and apoptosis, preventing uncontrolled growth and tumor formation.</li><br></ul>

<p>#<h2>Summary</h2></p>

<ul><br><li>The primary risk factor for most cancers is age, which increases the chance of genetic mutations leading to cancer development.</li><br><li>The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that monitors itself to ensure proper cell division. If problems occur, the cell may slow down or undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).</li><br><li>P53, a tumor suppressor protein, functions as a transcription factor and can direct cells to die in response to severe DNA damage.</li><br></ul>

<p>#<h2>Important Information</h2></p>

<ul><br><li>Table 10.1 lists selected oncogenes and their associated human cancers.</li><br><li>The process of cell division is driven by the interaction between cyclins and CDKs, which change concentration throughout the cell cycle.</li><br><li>P53 has been referred to as the "guardian of the cell" due to its role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis.</li><br></ul>
