# Antineoplastic Agents Strategies for Design [استراتيجيات تصميم الأدوية]

## Key Concepts

* **Antineoplastic agents**: Drugs used to treat cancer, which inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis.
* **5-fluorouracil (5-FU)**: A pyrimidine analogue that inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) and is a key component of various antineoplastic regimens.
* **Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase**: An enzyme responsible for the catabolic inactivation of 5-FU, which reduces its efficacy.

## Summary

* The mechanism of inhibition of TS by 5-fluorouracil involves binding to the enzyme's active site, preventing it from synthesizing thymidylate.
* Catabolic inactivation of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase reduces its efficacy and eliminates its anticancer effects.
* Metabolic activation of capecitabine to 5-FU is essential for its therapeutic activity.

## Important Information

* Key fact: The effectiveness of antineoplastic agents like 5-fluorouracil relies on their ability to target specific cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal tissues.
* Key fact: Understanding the mechanisms of action and metabolism of these drugs is crucial for optimizing treatment regimens and improving patient outcomes.
