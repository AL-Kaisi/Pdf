# Cancer Biology: Cell Cycle and Oncogenes
## Key Concepts

* **Cancer cells**: Cells that have acquired the ability to proliferate uncontrollably due to genetic mutations or alterations.
* **Cell cycle**: The process of cell division, consisting of G1, S, G2, and M phases, driven by proteins called cyclins and their associated CDKs.
* **Oncogenes**: Genes that are responsible for the development of cancer when mutated or altered. Proto-oncogenes can transform into oncogenes through mutations or translocations.
* **Tumor suppressor genes**: Genes that regulate cell division and apoptosis, preventing uncontrolled growth and tumor formation.

## Summary

* The primary risk factor for most cancers is age, which increases the chance of genetic mutations leading to cancer development.
* The cell cycle is a highly regulated process that monitors itself to ensure proper cell division. If problems occur, the cell may slow down or undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).
* P53, a tumor suppressor protein, functions as a transcription factor and can direct cells to die in response to severe DNA damage.

## Important Information

* Table 10.1 lists selected oncogenes and their associated human cancers.
* The process of cell division is driven by the interaction between cyclins and CDKs, which change concentration throughout the cell cycle.
* P53 has been referred to as the "guardian of the cell" due to its role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis.

## ملخص

* العامل الرئيسي للكثير من السرطانات هو العمر، والذي يزيد من فرصة حدوث تغيرات جينية leading to cancer development.
* الديناميكية الخلوية هي proceso highly regulated that monitors itself to ensure proper cell division. If problems occur، the cell may slow down or undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).
* P53، a tumor suppressor protein، functions as a transcription factor and can direct cells to die in response to severe DNA damage.
