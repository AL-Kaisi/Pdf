# [pH and Ka/pKa: Understanding Acid-Base Chemistry]

## Key Concepts

* **Strong acid**: A chemical that has a pKa value of -2 or lower, meaning it essentially does not react with water.
* **Weak acid**: A chemical that has a pKa value between 4 to 6, indicating that the conjugate base is weak and has some acidic properties in water.
* **pKa**: The negative logarithm of the dissociation constant (Ka) of an acid or base. It represents the ability of the proton donor form to release the proton into water to form H3O+.
* **Partition coefficient**: The ability of a chemical to partition through the lipid layers of the skin, making it corrosive.

## Summary

* Hydrochloric acid has a low pKa value (-6.1), making it a strong acid that does not react with water.
* Ephedrine HCl has a high pKa value (9.6), indicating that it is a weak base that holds onto the proton.
* Phenol has a pKa value of 9.9, but its ability to partition through skin makes it corrosive despite being an extremely weak acid.
* Understanding the drug's acid-base chemistry is important in adjusting the pH to ensure maximum water solubility or nonpolar media solubility.

## Important Information

* Percent ionization can be calculated using the pKa value and the pH of the solution. This is important for determining the ionic form of a drug.
* The pKa value represents the ability of the proton donor form to release the proton into water, not any other potential toxicities or properties.
* Understanding acid-base chemistry is crucial in handling acids and bases, as it can affect their reactivity and toxicity.
