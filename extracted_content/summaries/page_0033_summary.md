# [Drug Design Strategies]
## Key Concepts
* **Molecular Structure**: The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule.
* **Gelatin Material**: A clear, transparent material used to embed molecular structures.
* **Computer Graphics Images**: Visual representations of drug-receptor interactions generated by computer software.
* **Atomic Centers**: The central points of atoms that make up a protein structure.
* **Ribbon Structure**: A display method showing the backbone of a protein main chain as a ribbon-like shape.
* **Van der Waals Surface**: A molecular surface representation based on the exposed surfaces of individual atoms.
* **Solvent Accessible Surface**: A molecular surface representation generated by rolling a sphere (representing a water molecule) over the van der Waals surface.
* **Lee and Richards Surface**: A solvent-accessible surface constructed by rolling a sphere over the van der Waals surface, with the boundary taken as a line connecting the center of mass of the sphere from point to point.

## Summary
* The molecular structure of drugs is crucial for understanding their interactions with receptors.
* Computer graphics images provide insight into drug-receptor binding interactions.
* Various methods are used to represent molecular surfaces, including van der Waals surfaces and solvent-accessible surfaces.
* Solvent-accessible surfaces can be used as QSAR descriptors.

## Important Information
* Docking programs aim to locate compounds that can bind readily at the receptor.
* Current docking programs struggle to differentiate between known ligands and decoys.
* A database of docking decoys has been created to address this challenge.
