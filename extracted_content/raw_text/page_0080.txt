or N-7 of a purine base adjacent to the site of intercalation (Fig. 10.20).117,118 Additional stabilization is provided by hydrogen bonding of the amino-pyrimidine ring with a gua- nine residue in the minor groove. This also serves to orient the coordinated metal and the hydroperoxide ligand toward the minor groove. Bleomycin is notable for its lack of myelotoxicity, and this allows it to be combined with other myelosuppressants without a resulting additive effect. The acute toxicities seen with bleomycin are erythema (reddening of the skin), hyper- pigmentation (skin darkening) found predominately on the extremities, and pulmonary toxicity. The pulmonary toxic- ity may first occur as pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tis- sue), which normally responds to glucocorticosteroid ther- apy. Chronic pulmonary toxicity is expressed as pulmonary fibrosis, which is irreversible and limits utility of the agent. The toxicity profile of bleomycin is explained by its route of inactivation. Hydrolysis of the N-terminal amide to the car- boxylic acid increase the pKa of the amine at C-2 from 7.3 to 9.4, resulting in a greater degree of ionization and de- creased binding to DNA.119 The enzyme responsible for this conversion is known as bleomycin hydrolase, and it is pres- ent in most tissue but found in low concentration in skin and lung tissue. Tumor cells that are resistant to bleomycin may contain high levels of this enzyme. BLEOMYCIN SULFATE (BLEO, BLM, BLENOXANE) Bleomycin occurs as a white powder and is available in 15- and 30-U vials for reconstitution in water. It may be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. It is used Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 395 Figure 10.18 Structure of bleomycins.
