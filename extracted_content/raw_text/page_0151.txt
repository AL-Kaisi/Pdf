Hydrastis Hydrastis or goldenseal consists of the dried rhizome and roots of 1-fi1drastis cana- densis Linné (Fam. Ranunculaceac). Hijdrastis is Greek and means to accom- plish or act with water; the specific name refers to the habitat The plant is a pe- rennial herb with a short horizontal rhi- zome that bears numerous long, slender roots. Internally, the rhizome and roots show a golden yellow color. Goldenseal was plentiful in the forests of the eastern UnitedStates and Canada; in recent years, it has become almost extinct because of ruthless collection. Its market price is rel- atively high and presently approximates 516 per lb. Goldenseal has been cultivated in Oregon, Washington, North Carolina, Tennessee, Michigan, Wisconsin, and other localities; most of the commercial supply now comes from Arkansas and rom the Blue Ridge Mountain area. The plants, propagated from rhizome buds, 1uire 3 to 4 years to produce marketable drug. It is gathered in autumn, the terminal buds are replanted, and the drug is care- fully dried. Hydrastis was known to the Cherokee Indians, who used it as a dye and an internal remedy. These Indians in- troduced its use to the early American set- tiers. Three alkaloids have been isolated from hydrastis: hydrastine, berberine, and can- adirie. Of these, hydrastine (1.5 to 4%) is the most important. Hydrashs yields not less than 2.55k of the anhydrous ether- soluble alkaloids of hydrastis. USE. The hvdrastis alkaloids, hydrastine and berherine, are used as astringents in inflammation of the mucous membranes. Hydrastine is readily soluble in chloro- form, alcohol, and ether but almost insol- uble in water. It crystallizes in prisms, melt- ing at 131 to 132° C. CH -(> OCH, OCH ( ).fl.Hydrastine Hydrastine hydrochloride occurs as a white or creamy white powder that is odor- less, bitter, and hydroscopic. Berberine is readily soluble in water but almost insoluble in ether. The salts of ber- herinjrm bright yellow crystals. Sanguinara Sanguinaria or bloodroot is the dried rhizome of Stin'u,narw canadens,s Linné (Farn. Papaveraceae). The generic name is from sanuinaril.Is, meaning bloody, and re- fers to the color of the juice; canadensis re- fers to the plant habitat in Canada. The plant is a low perennial herb (Fig. 8-13) with a horizontal branching rhizome that hears slender roots and contains an orange- red latex. The rhizomes are dug during the early summer, deprived of their roots, and carefully dried. The plant grows in the rich open woodlands in North America east of the Mississippi. Most of the collection takes place in the eastern states. Bloodroot was used by the Indians to stain their faces and was also used as an acrid emetic. Its USC in homemade cough remedies seems to have been adopted by the early settlers. Sanguinaria contains alkaloids of the protopine series, including sanguinarine (about 1%), chelcrythrine, protopirle, and aliocryptopine. These alkaloids are color- less but tend to form colored salts. San- guinarine yields reddish salts with nitric or sulfuric acids; yellowish salts are formed with helerythrine. All alkaloids of sanguinaria are found in other members of the Papaveraceae and, like berberine and hvdrastirte, are isoquin-
