effects are rash, weakness, mucositis, nausea, edema, and anorexia. BORTEZOMIB (VELCADE) Proteasomes normally function to degrade proteins that are no longer needed by the cell. Such proteins are normally marked by the addition of ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid pro- tein that is added to the �-amino group of lysine residues on the target proteins. The marked proteins are then hy- drolyzed by the large barrel-shaped proteasomes to give peptides of 7 to 8 residues that may be further hydrolyzed and reutilized by the cell. This process serves to regulate protein levels within the cell, remove defective proteins, and becomes important in maintaining normal signal trans- duction. Inhibition of the proteasomes results in the build up of ubiquitylated proteins, which disrupts cell-signaling processes and cell growth (Fig. 10.28). The signaling by transcription factor NF-�B (nuclear factor �B) appears to be especially sensitive to bortezomib. NF-�B is associated with the transcription of antiapoptotic and proliferative genes but is under the control of I�B (inhibitor of NF-�B). I�B can itself be phosphorylated by IKK (I�B kinase), which marks I�B for ubiquitylation and destruction allow- ing NF-�B to mediate its antiapoptotic and proliferative ef- fects. In the presence of the competitive inhibitor borte- zomib (IC50 � 0.6 nM), the 26S proteasome is inhibited and the ubiquitylated I�B is still capable of inhibiting NF- �B, preventing its effects.161 The agent is used primarily in treating multiple myeloma, where NF-�B is thought to be especially important because of its regulation of VEGF and adhesion molecules, which play important roles in this cancer. The agent is also used in treating non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Bortezomib is available in 10-mL vials containing 3.5 mg that is administered intravenously for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The agent contains the unique boronic acid group, which serves as a bioisosteric replace- ment for an aldehyde functionality and forms a tetrahedral complex with a threonine hydroxyl group present on the proteasome. Several aldehydes were known to be protea- some inhibitors, but their incorporation resulted in racemi- zation of the �-carbon. The boronic acids were not suscep- tible to the same racemization, and stereochemistry was preserved in vivo giving maximal inhibition. The agent has a half-life of 9 to 15 hours with the major metabolizing en- zymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.162 Metabolism in- volves the oxidative removal of boron from the agent to give two diastereomeric carbinolamines. Both of the metabolites are inactive, the boronic acid functionality Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 407 Figure 10.27 Miscellaneous antineoplastic agents.
