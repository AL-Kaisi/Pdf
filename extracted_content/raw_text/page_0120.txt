912 SECTION 15 | Respiratory Disorders Corticosteroids • ICS are the preferred long-term control therapy for persistent asthma because of potency and consistent effectiveness; they are the only therapy shown to reduce risk of dying from asthma. See Table 79-3 for comparative ICS doses; all agents are approved for once- or twice-daily dosing. • Response to ICS is delayed; symptoms improve in most patients within the first 1–2 weeks and reach maximum improvement in 4–8 weeks. Maximum improvement in FEV1 and PEF rates may require 3–6 weeks. TABLE 79-2 Drug Doses for Treatment of Acute Severe Exacerbations of Asthma Dosages Medications ≥12 Years Old <12 Years Old Comments Ipratropium bromide MDI (18 mcg/puff) 8 puffs every 20 minutes as needed for up to 3 hours 4–8 puffs as needed every 2–4 hours Not to be continued once hospitalized Corticosteroids Prednisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone 50 mg in one or two divided doses (prednisone equivalent) 1 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg/day) in two divided doses (prednisone equivalent) For outpatient “burst” use 1–2 mg/kg/day, maximum 60 mg, for 3–5 days in children and 40–60 mg/ day in one or two divided doses for 5–7 days in adults Note: No advantage has been found for very-high-dose corticosteroids in acute severe asthma, nor is there any advantage for IV administration over oral therapy. The usual regimen is to continue the oral corticosteroid for the duration of hospitalization. The final duration of therapy following a hospitalization or emergency department visit may be from 3 to 10 days. If patients are then started on an ICS, there is no need to taper the systemic corticosteroid dose. An ICS can be started at any time during the exacerbation.
