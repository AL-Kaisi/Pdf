TABLE 41–3 Endocrine effects of insulin. Effect on liver: Reversal of catabolic features of insulin deficiency Inhibits glycogenolysis Inhibits conversion of fatty acids and amino acids to keto acids Inhibits conversion of amino acids to glucose Anabolic action Promotes glucose storage as glycogen (induces glucokinase and glycogen synthase, inhibits phosphorylase) Increases triglyceride synthesis and very­low­density lipoprotein formation Effect on muscle: Increased protein synthesis Increases amino acid transport Increases ribosomal protein synthesis Increased glycogen synthesis Increases glucose transport Induces glycogen synthase and inhibits phosphorylase Effect on adipose tissue: Increased triglyceride storage Lipoprotein lipase is induced and activated by insulin to hydrolyze triglycerides from lipoproteins Glucose transport into cell provides glycerol phosphate to permit esterification of fatty acids supplied by lipoprotein transport Intracellular lipase is inhibited by insulin GLUCAGON Chemistry & Metabolism Glucagon is synthesized in the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans (see Table 41–1). Glucagon is a peptide—identical in all mammals— consisting of a single chain of 29 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 3485. Selective proteolytic cleavage converts a large precursor molecule of approximately 18 000 MW to glucagon One of the precursor intermediates consists of a 69­amino­acid peptide called glicentin which contains the
