TABLE 41–3 Endocrine effects of insulin. Effect on liver: Reversal of catabolic features of insulin deficiency Inhibits glycogenolysis Inhibits conversion of fatty acids and amino acids to keto acids Inhibits conversion of amino acids to glucose Anabolic action Promotes glucose storage as glycogen (induces glucokinase and glycogen synthase, inhibits phosphorylase) Increases triglyceride synthesis and very­low­density lipoprotein formation Effect on muscle: Increased protein synthesis Increases amino acid transport Increases ribosomal protein synthesis Increased glycogen synthesis Increases glucose transport
