For example, the concentration may be expressed as grams per 100 mL, micrograms per milliliter, or milligrams per 100 mL. Figure 5.6 depicts concentration-time curves showing different peak height concentrations for equal amounts of drug from two different formulations fol­ lowing oral administration. The horizontal line drawn across the figure indicates that the mm1mum effec­ tive concentration (MEC) for the drug substance is 4.0 mg/mL. This means that for the patient to exhibit an adequate response to the drug, this concentration in the blood must be achieved. Comparing the blood levels of drug achieved after oral administration of equal doses of formulations A and B in Figure 5.6, formulation A will achieve the required blood levels of drug to produce the desired pharmacologic effect, whereas formulation B will not. On the other hand, if the MEC for the drug is Peak ::J" 6.0 ..
