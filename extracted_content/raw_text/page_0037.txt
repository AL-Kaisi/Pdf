Isosterism In the process of designing new pharmacologically active compounds or searching databases, it is important to not re- strict the definition of the structures to specific atoms. An im- portant concept is isosterism, a term that has been used widely to describe the selection of structural components—the steric, electronic, and solubility characteristics that make them inter- changeable in drugs of the same pharmacological class. The concept of isosterism has evolved and changed significantly in the years since its introduction by Langmuir in 1919.47 Langmuir, while seeking a correlation that would explain similarities in physical properties for nonisomeric molecules, defined isosteres as compounds or groups of atoms having the same number and arrangement of electrons. Isosteres that were isoelectric (i.e., with the same total charge as well as the same number of electrons) would possess similar physical properties. For example, the molecules N2 and CO both pos- sess 14 total electrons and no charge and show similar physi- cal properties. Related examples described by Langmuir were CO2, N2O, N3�, and NCO� (Table 2.11). With increased understanding of the structures of mole- cules, less emphasis has been placed on the number of elec- trons involved, because variations in hybridization during bond formation may lead to considerable differences in the angles, lengths, and polarities of bonds formed by atoms with the same number of peripheral electrons. Even the same atom may vary widely in its structural and electronic characteristics when it forms part of a different functional group. Thus, ni- trogen is part of a planar structure in the nitro group but forms the apex of a pyramidal structure in ammonia and amines. Groups of atoms that impart similar physical or chemical properties to a molecule because of similarities in size, elec- tronegativity, or stereochemistry are now frequently referred to by the general term of isostere. The early recognition that benzene and thiophene were alike in many of their properties (Fig. 2.27) led to the term ring equivalents for the vinylene group (—CHFCH—) and divalent sulfur (—S—). This con- cept has led to replacement of the sulfur atom in the phenothi- azine ring system of tranquilizing agents with the vinylene group to produce the dibenzodiazepine class of antidepres- sant drugs. The vinylene group in an aromatic ring system may be replaced by other atoms isosteric to sulfur, such as oxygen (furan) or NH (pyrrole); however, in such cases, aro- matic character is significantly decreased (Fig. 2.27). Examples of isosteric pairs that possess similar steric and electronic configurations are the carboxylate (COO�) and sulfonamide (SO2NR�) ions; ketone (CFO) and sulfone (OFSFO); chloride (Cl�) and trifluoromethyl (CF3); hy- drogen (MH) and fluorine (MF); hydroxy (MOH) and amine (MNH2); hydroxy (MOH) and thiol (MSH). Divalent ether (MOM), sulfide (MSM), amine (MNHM), and methylene (MCH2M) groups, although dissimilar electronically, are sufficiently alike in their steric nature to be frequently inter- changeable in designing new drugs.48 Compounds may be altered by isosteric replacements of atoms or groups, to develop analogs with select biological effects or to act as antagonists to normal metabolites. Each series of compounds showing a specific biological effect must be considered separately, because there are no general rules that predict whether biological activity will be in- creased or decreased. Some examples of this type follow.
