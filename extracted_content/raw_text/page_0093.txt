being necessary for binding of the proteasome. The elimi- nation of the agent has not been well characterized. The major toxicities seen with the agent are generalized weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, peripheral neuropa- thy, fever, and orthostatic hypotension. Myelosuppression also occurs normally as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. VORINOSTAT (SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID, SAHA, ZOLINZA) Histones are proteins around which DNA is wound in the process of packing DNA into the nucleus. They also have a role in regulating the transcription of genes, and this is controlled by the covalent modifications acetylation, phos- phorylation, and methylation to which they are subject. The specific modifications present on the histones or his- tone code has been proposed to determine which transcrip- tion factors associate with specific genes and result in their replication.163 Acetylation occurs at the �-amino group of lysine and is accomplished by histone acetyltransferase en- zymes, whereas deacetylation is accomplished by histone deacetylase enzymes. The result of inhibition of histone deacetylase is hyperacetylation of lysine residues of the hi- stone proteins. The positively charged �-amino groups of the lysine residues are believed to interact with the nega- tively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. Once acetyla- tion has occurred, this interaction is prevented, and the binding of transcription factors is favored. Therefore, the inhibition of deacetylation by vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACis), results in the increased transcription of certain genes. Specifically, this has been associated with upregulation of a regulatory protein known as p21, which serves to inhibit progression past the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Other genes and their proteins are also effected by vorionostat such as Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) and BCL6. Vorinostat fits the basic pharmacophore for the HDACis (Fig. 10.29), which consists of a hydrophobic cap region connected to a zinc coordinating functionality by a hy- drophobic linker.164 The hydroxamic acid functionality is capable of bidendate binding to zinc present in the enzyme and is a major factor in the overall binding of the compound. The compound inhibits HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 classes of this enzyme with nanomolar (�86 nM) IC50 values.165 408 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 10.28 Actions of proteasomes on NF-�B.
