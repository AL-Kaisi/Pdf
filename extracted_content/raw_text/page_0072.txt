apoptosis in numerous ways, and this has been linked to the increased production of H2O2 and hydroxyl radical. One pro- posed mechanism involves damage to the mitochondrial membrane by H2O2 and �OH resulting in the release of cy- tochrome c, which would activate the intrinsic pathway (Fig. 10.2).78 This sequence of events would be desirable in a cancer cell but not in a normal cardiac cell. Additional mechanisms of cardiotoxicity have been pro- posed, which involve the metabolic reduction of the anthra- cycline C-13 ketone to the alcohol.79 Several pharmacolog- ical effects have been associated with the resulting alcohols including loss of Ca�2 homeostasis and inhibition of Na�/K�-ATPase in cardiac cells. The formation of doxoru- bicin C-13 alcohol, doxorubicinol has been associated with conversion of iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) into a null protein that is no longer able to maintain iron homeostasis.80 It has been proposed that the loss of iron regulation may contribute to the cardiotoxicity seen with doxorubicin. However, compared with doxorubicin, daunorubicin and idarubicin form greater amounts of the alcohol metabolites and exhibit similar and reduced cardiotoxicity, respectively. This suggests that metabolism to the alcohols is not solely responsible for the cardiotoxicity. Several strategies have been developed to reduce the car- diotoxicity associated with the anthracyclines. Slow infu- sion over 48 to 96 hours versus administration of a bolus given over 15 minutes was implemented in the 1980s and has proven to be effective in reducing the toxicity without adversely affecting the antineoplastic effects. Given the pro- posed mechanism of toxicity, it is not surprising that several antioxidants have been investigated including vitamins A, C, and E and also thiol-containing reducing agents such as acetylcysteine. These, however, have not proved effective in large measure. An alternative strategy is to chelate the iron required for the activation of H2O2, and for this, dexrazox- ane (Totect) is used.81 Radiolabeling experiment have shown that dexrazoxane is rapidly taken up into myocardial cells, where it is subsequently hydrolyzed by a two-step process to yield the diamide acid (Scheme 10.26), which chelates free iron and iron bound to the anthracycline and is similar to the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This has been proven effective and has al- lowed patients to tolerate higher doses and increased num- bers of cycles of the anthracyclines. Dexrazoxane is also an inhibitor of topoisomerase II that, unlike the anthracyclines, does not result in strand breaks.82 This additional property is important in its utility as antidote in cases of anthracycline extravasation.83 The anthracyclines are often administered with other antineoplastics such as the taxanes and trastuzumab, which may have cardiotoxicities themselves leading to an increased risk despite the precautions mentioned. Related to the anthracyclines is mitoxantrone, which is shown in Figure 10.14. Although mitoxantrone is a syn- thetic agent, it is included with the natural products because it is mechanistically similar to the anthracyclines. Produced in the late 1970s, it is a derivative of a synthetic dye and is classified as an anthracenedione.84 The mechanism involves intercalation by the chromophore, which is stabilized by the 2-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]ethanol side chain presumably as a Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 387 Scheme 10.25 Process of anthracycline redox cycling.
