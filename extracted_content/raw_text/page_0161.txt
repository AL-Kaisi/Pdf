222� ALKALOIDS of the isoprenoid moiety of agroclavine will be labeled indicating a second isomeriza- tion. Agroclavine undergoes stepwise ox- idation to elymoclavine and eventually to lysergic acid. The carboxyl group of ly -sergic acid forms a peptide linkage with an amino group of a variety of amino acids or peptide residues to yield the therapeuti- cally useful ergot alkaloids. Synthesis of lysergic acid derivatives and clavine alkaloids in higher plants (Ipomoea species) apparently takes place from the same precursors. Rauwolfia Serpentina Rauwolfia serpentina is the dried root of Rauvolfia serpentina (Linné) Bentham ex Kurz (Fam. Apocvnaceae). Sometimes fragments of rhizome and aerial stern bases are attached (Fig. 8-18). When assayed as directed, it contains not less than 0.15 11/c, 01 reserpine-rescinnamine group alkaloids, calculated as reserpine. The genus name was selected in honor of Dr. Leonhard Rau- wolf, a noted 16th century German bota- nist, physician, and explorer; serpcntina re- fers to the long, tapering, snakelike roots of the plant. It must he emphasized that the name of the drug and the name of the genus of plants from which it derives are spelled differently. For technical reasons, the genus must be spelled with a v instead of a w. The plant Rtnwolfia serpentina is thus the correct botanic origin of the drug rau- wolfia serpentina (rauwolfia). For centuries Rauvolfia serpentina was used by the medicine men of India to treat a variety of maladies, ranging from snake- bite to insanity. In 1563, Garcia de Orta mentioned the plant and its uses in his book on the drugs of India, but European physicians were skeptical of its properties. Consequently, it was not until 1952, when Muller succeeded in isolating the alkaloid, reserpine, that this plant was conceded to be valuable. In the form of the powdered root, the alkaloidal extract, and purified al- kaloids, rauwolfia serpentina has become an exceedingly important therapeutic aid in the treatment and control of hyperten- sion. The plant is referred to as sarpngandha in Sanskrit, chota-chand or chandnka in Hindi, pagla-ka-dawa (insanity cure) in the dialect of Bihar, and also by such other names as pataia-gandhi, dhanburua, and covanarnilpori. A native plant of India, Burma, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, rauwolfia occurs in hot, moist regions. Practically all commercial supplies at the present time come from India and Thailand. Three varieties of R. serpentina roots have been sold on the Indian mar- kets: Bihar, Dehra Dun, and Assam. K. serpentina is an erect shrub that reaches 1 meter in height and has cylindric sterns. These stems bear pale bark and ex- hibit a light-colored viscous latex when ruptured. It has leaves that may be simple and opposite or, more commonly, ar- ranged in whorls of 3 to 5. The white or pale rose flowers are arranged in terminal and axillary cymes. The fruit is a single, 2-lobed drupe that turns purplish black when mature. Three series of alkaloids have been re- ported: (1) weakly basic indole alkaloids, (2) indoline alkaloids of intermediate ba- sicity, and (3) strong anhvdronium bases. The principal alkaloids, reserpine, rescin- namine, and deserpidine, are tertiary in- dole alkaloids that have a carbocyclic struc- ture in ring E. Other tertiary indole alkaloids exhibit a heterocyclic structure in ring E: -yohimbine (identical with aj- malicine, tetra h ydroserpentine,and rau- basine) and reserpiline. Ajmaline, isoa1ma- line, rauwolfinine, and others are listed as tertiary indoline alkaloids; however, these bases do not have a tranquilizing action. Serpentine, serpentinine, and alstonine are classed as strongly basic anhydronium al- kaloids. The latter type is not considered of practical therapeutic importance. From the 25 or more species of Rauvolfia inves- tigated, at least 50 alkaloids have been re- ported. Rauwolfia alkaloids probably exert their
