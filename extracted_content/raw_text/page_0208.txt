Aldosterone receptor antagonists in particular also have a favorable effect on cardiac function in people with heart failure and as polypharmacy in patients with resistant hypertension. Some pharmacokinetic characteristics and the initial and usual maintenance dosages of diuretics are listed in Table 11–2. Although thiazide diuretics are more natriuretic at higher doses (up to 100–200 mg of hydrochlorothiazide), when used as a single agent, lower doses (25–50 mg) exert as much antihypertensive effect as do higher doses. In contrast to thiazides, the blood pressure response to loop diuretics continues to increase at doses many times greater than the usual therapeutic dose.
