192� ALKALOIDS Biosynthesis of Tropane Alkaloids Because of the commercial importance of hyoscyamine and scopolamine, investiga- tion of their biosynthesis has been exten- sive, especially in Datura species. Feeding studies with labeled orruthine have re- vealed that this amino acid is incorporated stereospecifically to form the pyrrolidine ring of tropine. The remaining 3 carbon atoms are derived from acetate and thus complete the piperidine moiety. Methyla- tion results via trans methylation from S-adenosylmethionine to complete the tro- pine nucleus. Phenylalanine is the precursor of tropic acid. Tracer studies have shown that the side chain of the amino acid undergoes a novel type of intramolecular rearrange- ment during the conversion. Esterification of tropic acid with tropine produces hyo- scyamine. These reactions are summarized in Figure 8-4. The important drugs and alkaloids in this group are belladonna leaf, hyoscy- anlus, stramoniurn, atropine, hyoscy- amine, scopolamine, coca, and cocaine. Belladonna Belladonna leaf, belladonna herb, or deadly nightshade leaf consists of the dried leaf and flowering or fruiting top of Atropa belladonna Linné or of its variety ac- urninata Royle ex Lindley (Earn. Solana- ceae) (Fig. 8-5). Belladonna leaf yields not less than 0.35% of alkaloids. Atropa is from Atropos, meaning inflexi- ble, the name of the Greek Fate who cuts the thread of life, and probably alludes to the poisonous character of the drug. Bel- ladonna is from the Italian be/la, meaning beautiful, and donna, meaning lady. (The juice of the berry, when placed in the eyes, causes dilation of the pupils, thus giving a striking appearance.) The plant is a perennial herb that grows to a meter in height. It is indigenous to central and southern Europe and to Asia Minor and is cultivated in sunny locations in England, Germany, India, and the United States. At present, the chief source of supply is the Balkans. Belladonna was probably known to the ancients, but the first authentic notice ap- peared in 1504. The poisonous character of the plant has been known for many years, particularly in its indigenous localities. It was the subject of many treatises during the 18th century. Its mydriatic properties were first recorded in 1802, but its analgesic properties were not recognized until 1860. The leaves were used earlier than the root, whose use did not occur until about 1860. The stems are cut about halfway down when the fruits begin to form and the al- kaloids arc most abundant. After rains or irrigation, the plant produces a second crop of leaves and flowers, which are gath- ered in the fall. Most of the herb crop is dried or partially dried and extracted with acidified water to obtain the alkaloids. A fine grade of leaf is obtained by hand pick- ing the leaves and drying them rapidly at rather low temperatures and in the shade. The leaf yields alkaloids in concentra- tions ranging up to more than 1%. About three fourths of the isolated alkaloid mix- ture is (- )-hyoscyan1ine; the remainder is atropine. The latter compound exists, at most, only in traces in fresh plant material. Atropine is formed by racemization during the extraction process. Small but varying amounts of other bases are found in the root but not in the leaf. These include apoatropine, belladonnine, cuscohygrine, and scopolamine. The yield of alkaloids averages as fol- lows: roots, 0.6%; stems, 0.05%; leaves, 0.4%; unripe berries, 0.19%; ripe berries, 0.21 1k; seeds, 0.33%. USES AND DOSE. Belladonna acts as a parasympathetic depressant, which ac- counts for its use as a spasmolytic agent. The drug is used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer; functional digestive disorders, including spastic, mu- cous, and ulcerative colitis; and diarrhea, diverticulitis, and pancreatitis.
