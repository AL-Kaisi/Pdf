TABLE 41–2 Glucose transporters. Transporter Tissues Glucose Km (mmol/L) Function GLUT 1 All tissues, especially red cells, brain 1–2 Basal uptake of glucose; transport across the blood­brain barrier GLUT 2 Beta cells of pancreas; liver, kidney; gut 15–20 Regulation of insulin release, other aspects of glucose homeostasis GLUT 3 Brain, placenta <1 Uptake into neurons, other tissues GLUT 4 Muscle, adipose ∼5 Insulin­mediated uptake of glucose GLUT 5 Gut, kidney 1–2 Absorption of fructose Various hormonal agents (eg, glucocorticoids) lower the affinity of insulin receptors for insulin; growth hormone in excess increases this affinity slightly. Aberrant serine and threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunits or IRS molecules may result in insulin resistance and functional receptor down­regulation. Effects of Insulin on Its Targets Insulin promotes the storage of fat as well as glucose (both sources of energy) within specialized target cells (Figure 41–4) and influences cell growth and the metabolic functions of a wide variety of tissues (Table 41–3). FIGURE 41–4 Insulin promotes synthesis (from circulating nutrients) and storage of glycogen, triglycerides, and protein in its major target tissues: liver, fat, and muscle. The release of insulin from the pancreas is stimulated by increased blood glucose, incretins, vagal nerve stimulation, and other factors (see text).
