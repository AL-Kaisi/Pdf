nucleotide is a substrate for RNA polymerases, and 5-FU is incorporated into the RNA of some cell lines. The incorpo- ration of 5-FU into DNA via DNA polymerase occurs in some tissue lines even though uracil is not a common com- ponent of human DNA. The 5-FU in DNA likely serves as substrate for the editing and repair enzymes involved in DNA processing for cell division and tissue growth. The ac- tual addition of 5-FU into RNA and/or DNA may not be the direct cytotoxic event, but the incorporation may lead to less efficient utilization of cellular resources. The significance of these various mechanisms on the overall cytotoxic effects of 5-FU may vary with cell line and tissue. The metabolic activation (anabolism) of 5-FU required to produce the anticancer effects accounts for no more than 20% of the administered amount of drug in most patients. Catabolic inactivation via the normal pathways for uracil con- sumes the remaining approximate 80% of the dose. The major enzyme of pyrimidine catabolism is dihydropyrimidine dehy- drogenase (DPD), and 5-FU is a substrate for this enzyme.55 The DPD catabolism of 5-FU is shown in Scheme 10.20. The formation of dihydro-5-FU (5-FU-H2) occurs very rapidly and accounts for the majority of the total 5-FU dose in most patients. Thus, �-fluoro-�-alanine is the major human metabolite of 5-FU.56 Uracil is a substrate for this enzyme system also and has been dosed with 5-FU and 5-FU prodrugs in an attempt to saturate DPD and conserve active drug species. Variability in the levels of DPD activity among the patient population is a major factor in the bioavailability of 5- FU. Inhibitors of DPD such as uracil or 5-chloro-2,4- dihydroxypyridine (CDHP)53 increase the plasma concentra- tion–time curve of 5-FU by preventing 5-FU catabolism. One mechanism of drug resistance in 5-FU–treated patients may be caused by increased levels of DPD in the target tissue. The observed low bioavailability of 5-FU as a result of the cata- bolic efficiency of DPD and other enzymes has lead to the de- velopment of unique dosing routes and schedules as well as the development of prodrug forms of 5-FU.53 Attempts at chemical modification of 5-FU to protect from catabolic events have produced several prodrug forms, which are converted via in vivo metabolic and/or chemical transformation to the parent drug 5-FU.57 Figure 10.8 shows the structure of the more common prodrug forms of 5-FU. The carbamate derivative of 5�-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine is known as capecitabine, and it is converted to 5-FU through a series of activation steps. The activation sequence is shown in Scheme 10.21. The initial step is carbamate hy- drolysis followed by deamination, then hydrolysis of the sugar moiety to yield 5-FU. Some of these activation steps take place at a higher rate in tumor tissue leading to selec- tive accumulation in those cells.53 The last step in the se- quence shown in Scheme 10.21 is catalyzed by phosphoro- lases, and these enzymes occur in higher levels in colorectal tumors. Despite this complex activation process, capecitabine still exhibits some of the significant toxicities of 5-fluorouracil. The tetrahydrofuran derivative tegafur is slowly converted to 5-FU but requires quite high doses to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations. Esters of the N-hy- droxymethyl derivative of tegafur show greater anticancer activity than tegafur.58 Pyrimidine analogs as antimetabolites for cancer therapy have been developed based on the cytosine structure as well. Modification of the normal ribose or deoxyribose moiety has produced useful drug species such as cytarabine (ara-C) and gemcitabine, see Figure 10.8. Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C or cytarabine) is simply the arabinose sugar instead Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 375 Figure 10.8 Anticancer drugs based on pyrimidine and related compounds.
