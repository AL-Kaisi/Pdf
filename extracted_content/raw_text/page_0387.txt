Carbohydrate metabolism 180 stimulates the b-cells of the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin may further enhance hepatic and muscle glycogenesis. More importantly, entry of glucose into adipose tissue and muscle cells, unlike that into liver and brain, is stimulated by insulin and, under physiological conditions, the plasma glucose concentration falls to near fasting levels. Conversion of intracellular glucose to G6P in adipose and muscle cells is catalysed by the enzyme hexokinase, which, because its affinity for glucose is greater than that of hepatic glucokinase, ensures that glucose enters the metabolic pathways in these tissues at lower extracellular concentrations than those in the liver. The relatively high insulin activity after a meal also inhibits the breakdown of triglyceride (lipolysis) and protein (proteolysis). If there is relative or absolute insulin deficiency, as in diabetes mellitus, these actions are impaired. Both muscle and adipose tissue store the excess post-prandial glucose, but the mode of storage and the function of the two types of cell are very different, as will be shown later. Ketosis Adipose tissue and the liver Adipose tissue triglyceride is the most important long- term energy store in the body. Greatly increased use of fat stores, for example during prolonged fasting, is associated with ketosis. Adipose tissue cells, acting in conjunction with the liver, convert excess glucose to triglyceride and store it in this form rather than as glycogen. The components are both derived from glucose, fatty acids from the glucose entering hepatic cells and glycerol from that entering adipose tissue cells.
