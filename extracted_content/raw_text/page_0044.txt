formation increases the reactivity of the nucleophile compared with the un-ionized form (MO� is more nucleophilic than OH). Reaction with water is also possible, because it repre- sents the nucleophile in greatest abundance in the body and this becomes more likely as the electrophile becomes more reactive. Reaction involves displacement of a leaving group on the electrophile by the nucleophile. The reactivity of the electrophile is dependent in part on the ability of the leaving group to stabilize a negative charge. Along with a common mechanism, there are other charac- teristics that the alkylating agents share. Mechanisms by which cells may become resistant to these agents are thought to be similar and include decreased cellular uptake, increased inactivation by detoxifying nucleophilic thiols such as glu- tathione, increased DNA repair processes, and decreased drug activation when this is necessary for generation of an alkylat- ing species. Functioning apoptotic mechanisms are thought to be important for the effectiveness of these agents at normal doses, and those cells that do not possess these mechanisms may not respond. In high-dose therapy involving bone mar- row transplants, the cell may be overwhelmed by the damage caused by these agent and die because of necrosis. The alkyl- ating agents are thought to be effective from G0-M and are, therefore, not considered cell cycle–specific agents. Many of the toxicities seen with the various agents are similar. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal (GI) disruption, which often present as nausea and vomiting are commonly seen and are caused by the highly proliferative nature of these tissues, and therefore susceptibility to the effects of the alkylating agents. It is interesting to note that although cancer cells may develop resistance to the alkylating agents, this is not gener- ally seen for cells of the bone marrow and GI tract because of the genetic stability and functioning DNA repair mechanisms present in these cells. However, an additional long-term consequence of the administration of these agents is the emergence of secondary cancers that are associated with the mutagenic effects of the alkylating agents themselves. NITROGEN MUSTARDS The nitrogen mustards are compounds that are chemically similar to sulfur mustard or mustard gas developed and used in World War I. The term “mustard” comes from the similar- ity in the blisters produced by the compound and those seen upon exposure to the oil of black mustard seeds. Investigation of sulfur mustard revealed that it possessed an- tineoplastic properties but because the compound existed as a gas at room temperature, handling and administration of the material were difficult. Conversion of the sulfide to a ter- tiary amine allowed for the formation of salts, which exist as solids at room temperature allowing for easier handling and dosing. The term mustard was then extended to the nitrogen analogs (nitrogen mustards) given their chemical similarity. Mustards such as mechlorethamine are classified as di- alkylating agents in that one mustard molecule can alkylate two nucleophiles.5 The initial acid–base reaction is necessary to release the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen, which sub- sequently displaces chloride to give the highly reactive aziri- dinium cation (Scheme 10.3). Nucleophilic attack can then occur at the aziridinium carbon to relieve the small ring strain and neutralize the charge on nitrogen. This process can then be repeated provided a second leaving group is present.6 Mechlorethamine is highly reactive, in fact, too reactive and therefore nonselective, making it unsuitable for oral Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 359 Scheme 10.2 General reaction for alkylation and inactivation of alkylating agents.
