If the dissolution of a given drug particle is rapid or if the drug is administered as a solution and remains present in the body as such, the rate at which the drug becomes absorbed depends mainly on its ability to traverse the membrane barrier. However, if the rate of dissolution for a drug particle is slow because of the physicochemical char­ acteristics of the drug substance or the dosage form, dis­ solution itself is a rate-limiting step in absorption. Slowly soluble drugs such as digoxin may not only be absorbed at a slow rate; they may be incompletely absorbed or in some cases largely unabsorbed following oral administra­ tion because of the natural limitation of time that they may remain within the stomach or the intestinal tract. Thus, poorly soluble drugs or poorly formulated drug products may be incompletely absorbed and pass unchanged out of the system via the feces. Under normal circumstances, a drug may be expected to remain in the stomach for 2 to 4 hours (gastric emptying time) and in the small intestine for 4 to 10 hours, although there is substantial variation between people and even in the same person on different occasions. Various tech­ niques have been used to determine gastric emptying time and the gastrointestinal passage of drug from various oral dosage forms, including tracking dosage forms labeled with gamma-emitting radionuclides through gamma scin­ tigraphy (2,3). The gastric emptying time for a drug is most rapid with a fasting stomach, becoming slower as the food content is increased. Changes in gastric emptying time and/ or in intestinal motility can affect drug transit time and thus the opportunity for drug dissolution and absorption. These changes can be affected by drugs. Certain drugs with anticholinergic properties, for example, dicyclomine HCl and amitriptyline HCl, can slow gastric emptying. This can enhance the rate of absorption of drugs normally absorbed from the stomach and reduce the rate of absorp­ tion of drugs that are primarily absorbed from the small intestine. Alternatively, drugs that enhance gastric motil­ ity, for example, laxatives, may cause some drugs to move through the gastrointestinal system and past their absorp­ tive site at such a rate as to reduce the amount of drug absorbed. This effect has been demonstrated with digoxin, whose absorption is significantly decreased by accelerat­ ing gastrointestinal motility. Aging may also influence gastrointestinal absorption. In the elderly, gastric acidity, the number of absorptive cells, intestinal blood flow, the rate of gastric emptying, and intestinal motility are all decreased. However, drugs in which absorption depends on passive processes are not affected by these factors as much as are those that depend on active transport mechanisms, such as calcium, iron, thiamine, and sugars. A decrease in gastric emptying time is advantageous for drugs that are absorbed from the stomach but disadvantageous for those that are prone to acid degradation, such as penicillins and erythromycin, or inactivated by stomach enzymes, such as L-dopa. The dissolution of a substance may be described by the modified Noyes-Whitney equation: where de - = kS(c - c ) dt s t de/ dt is the rate of dissolution, k is the dissolution rate constant, S is the surface area of the dissolving solid, c, is the saturation concentration of drug in the diffu­ sion layer ( which may be approximated by the maxi­ mum solubility of the drug in the solvent, because the diffusion layer is considered saturated), and ct is the concentration of the drug in the dissolution medium at time t ( c, - ct is the concentration gradient). The rate of dissolution is governed by the rate of diffu­ sion of solute molecules through the diffusion layer into the body of the solution. The equation reveals that the dissolution rate of a drug may be increased by increasing the surface area (reducing the particle size) of the drug, by increasing the solubility of the drug in the diffusion layer, and by factors embodied in the dissolution rate constant, k, including the intensity of agitation of the sol­ vent and the diffusion coefficient of the dissolving drug. For a given drug, the diffusion coefficient and usually the concentration of the drug in the diffusion layer will increase with increasing temperature. Also, increasing the rate of agitation of the dissolving medium will increase the rate of dissolution. A reduction in the viscosity of the solvent employed is another means to enhance the dis­ solution rate of a drug. Changes in the pH or the nature of the solvent that influence the solubility of the drug may be used to advantage in increasing dissolution rate.
