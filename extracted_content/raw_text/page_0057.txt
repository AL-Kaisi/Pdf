via the previously mentioned carbinolamines. Elimination oc- curs primarily in the urine as mostly demethylated metabo- lites with a terminal elimination half-life of 4 to 10 hours. Myleosuppression and nausea/vomiting are dose-limiting toxicities. Other adverse effects include lethargy, agitation, hallucinations, skin rash, and elevations in transaminase lev- els, flulike symptoms, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. ANTIMETABOLITES Antimetabolites are compounds closely related in structure to a cellular precursor molecule, yet these imposter sub- stances are capable of preventing the proper use or forma- tion of the normal cellular product. These antimetabolites are similar enough in structure in many cases to interact with the normal cellular process but differ in a manner suf- ficient to alter the outcome of that pathway. Most an- timetabolites are effective cancer chemotherapeutic agents via interaction with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. Therefore, several of the useful drugs used in antimetabolite therapy are purines, pyrimidines, folates, and related com- pounds. The antimetabolite drugs may exert their effects by several individual mechanisms involving enzyme inhibition at active, allosteric, or related sites. Most of these targeted enzymes and processes are involved in the regulatory steps of cell division and cell/tissue growth. Often the adminis- tered drug is actually a prodrug form of an antimetabolite and requires activation in vivo to yield the active inhibitor. The administration of many purine and pyrimidine an- timetabolites requires the formation of the nucleoside and fi- nally the corresponding nucleotide for antimetabolite activ- ity. An antimetabolite and its transformation products may inhibit several different enzymes involved in tissue growth. These substances are generally cell cycle specific with ac- tivity in the S phase. The purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites are often compounds incorporated into nucleic acids and the nucleic acid polymers (DNA, RNA, etc.). The antifolates are com- pounds designed to interact at cofactor sites for enzymes in- volved in the biosynthesis of nucleic acid bases. The biosyn- thesis of these nucleic acid bases depend heavily on the availability of folate cofactors, hence antimetabolites of the folates find utility as antineoplastic agents. The antitumor effects of all these compounds attempting to masquerade as the natural precursor compound may occur because of a malfunction in the biosynthesis of the corresponding macro- molecules. Classic examples of pyrimidine and purine an- timetabolites are 5-fluorouracil and 6-mercaptopurine, re- spectively, and the classic antifolate is methotrexate. The purine analog 6-mercaptopurine and its bioactivation products interact with many enzymes in the various stages of cell division.52 The activity of 6-mercaptopurine requires bioactivation to its ribonucleotide, 6-thioinosinate, by the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). 6-Thioinosinate is a potent inhibitor of the con- version of 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate into 5-phospho- ribosylamine. The ribose diphosphate and triphosphates of 6-mercaptopurine are active enzyme inhibitors, and the triphosphate can be incorporated into DNA and RNA to in- hibit chain elongation. The pyrimidine analog 5-fluorouracil was designed based on the observation that in certain tumors, uracil was used for nucleic acid pyrimidine biosynthesis.53 Fluorine, at the 5-position of uracil, blocks the conversion of uridy- late to thymidylate, thus diminishing DNA biosynthesis. The fluorine induced increase in acidity (inductive effect) was expected to cause the molecule to bind more strongly to enzymes of the various stages of pyrimidine biosynthe- sis. Thymidine is a logical target, because it is only found in DNA and not in RNA. 5-Fluorouracil is activated by anabolism to 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridylic acid, and this acti- vated species is a strong inhibitor of thymidylate syn- thetase, the enzyme that converts 2�-deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. Methotrexate inhibits the binding of the substrate folic acid to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), result- ing in reductions in the synthesis of nucleic acid bases, per- haps most importantly, the conversion of uridylate to thymidylate as catalyzed by thymidylate synthetase, which requires folate cofactors. The pathways for the normal biosynthesis of the pyrimi- dine and purine bases are summarized in Schemes 10.15 and 10.16, respectively. The biosynthesis of pyrimidine and purine monomers is a central component for DNA and RNA formation in mammalian cells. The process of cell division and tissue growth is a very complex set of biochemical events with many feedback controls. Thus, antimetabolite drugs based on pyrimidine, purine, and related structures may exert their effects by altering many metabolic processes and pathways. The final step in Figure 10.15 illustrates the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides cat- alyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. The substrate for this enzyme is the ribonucleotide diphosphate, and the process is the same for both purine and pyrimidine bases. Pyrimidine Drugs The anticancer drugs based on pyrimidine structure are shown in Figure 10.8. The pyrimidine derivative 5-fluo- rouracil (5-FU) was designed to block the conversion of uri- dine to thymidine. The normal biosynthesis of thymidine in- volves methylation of the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring of uridine. The replacement of the hydrogen at the 5-posi- tion of uracil with a fluorine results in an antimetabolite drug, leading to the formation of a stable covalent ternary complex composed of 5-FU, thymidylate synthase (TS), and cofactor (a tetrahydrofolate species). The normal pathway for the formation of thymidine from uridine catalyzed by the enzyme TS is shown in Scheme 10.17. Anticancer drugs tar- geting this enzyme should selectively inhibit the formation of DNA because thymidine is not a normal component of RNA. TS is responsible for the reductive methylation of de- oxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) by 5,10-methylenete- trahydrofolate to yield dTMP and dihydrofolate.54 Because thymine is unique to DNA, the TS enzyme system plays an important role in replication and cell division. The tetrahy- drofolate cofactor species serves as both the one-carbon donor and the hydride source in this system. The initial step of the process involves the nucleophilic attack by a sulfhydryl group of a cystine residue at the 6-position of dUMP. The resulting enolate adds to the methylene of 5,10- CH2-THF perhaps activated via the very reactive N-5- iminium ion (see Scheme 10.17). The iminium ion likely forms at N-5 and only after 5,10-CH2-THF binds to TS.54 372 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry
