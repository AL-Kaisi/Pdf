generate a carbocation but also undergoes internal cycliza- tion to give 2-azo-hypoxanthine.46 Formation of diazo-IC has been associated with pain at the injection site, which is often seen during dacarbazine administration.47 Methylation of DNA occurs at N-7, N-3 and O-6 of guanine among other sites.48 Dacarbazine proved to be more active against murine tumors than against human tumors. This was attributed to the enhanced ability of mice to metabolize the agent to MTIC and the subsequent conversion to a methylating species.49 Building on this idea was temozolomide, which undergoes conversion to the same intermediate, MTIC, as dacarbazine, but it does not require metabolic activation to do so.50,51 Hydrolysis of temozolomide gives the carboxy-triazene, which spontaneously loses CO2 to give MTIC. Dacarbazine must be administered intravenously; however, the related temozolomide may be administered orally.
