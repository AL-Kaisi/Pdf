909 Asthma | CHAPTER 79 become worse, or require more than 8 inhalations in a 24-hour period, or there are more than two episodes in a week. • Two long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), formoterol (Foradil) and salmeterol (Ser- event), provide bronchodilation for 12 hours or longer and are dosed twice daily. When combined with an ICS, formoterol may be dosed on a daily and as-needed basis (thus, more frequently than twice daily). Effective asthma self-management education requires: If PEF or FEV1 <60% of best, or not improving after 48 hours • Self-monitoring of symptoms and/or lung function • Written asthma action plan • Regular medical review All patients Continue reliever Continue controller Add prednisolone 40-50 mg/day Contact doctor Increase reliever Early increase in controller as below Review response EARLY or MILD Medication Increase usual reliever: Increase frequency of SABA use For pMDI, add spacer A A A Short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) Low dose ICS/formoterola Short-term change (1-2 weeks) for worsening asthma Evidence Level LATE or SEVERE Increase frequency of reliever use (maximum formoterol total 72 mcg/day Add oral corticosteroids (OCS) and contact doctor A B B D A D B Increase usual controller: Maintenance and reliever ICS/formoterola Continue maintenance ICS/formoterol and increase reliever ICS/formoterol as neededa (maximum formoterol total 72 mcg/day) At least double ICS; consider increasing ICS to high dose (maximum 2000 mcg/day BDP equivalent) Quadruple maintenance ICS/formoterol (maximum formoterol 72 mcg/day) Step up to higher dose formulation of ICS/other LABA, or consider adding a separate ICS inhaler (to maximum total 2000 mcg/day BDP equivalent) Maintenance ICS with SABA as reliever Maintenance ICS/formoterol with SABA as reliever Maintenance ICS/other LABA with SABA as reliever OCS (prednisone or prednisolone) Add OCS for severe exacerbations (eg, PEF or FEV1 <60% personal best or predicted), or patient not responding to treatment over 48 hours. Once started, morning dosing is preferable. Tapering is not needed if OCS are prescribed for <2 weeks Adults: prednisolone 40-50 mg/day (maximum 50 mg) usually for 5-7 days. Children 6-11 years: 1-2 mg/kg/day (maximum 40 mg) usually for 3-5 days FIGURE 79-2. Self-management of worsening asthma in adults and adolescents with a written asthma action plan.
