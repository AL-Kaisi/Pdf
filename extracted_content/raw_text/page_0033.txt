molecular structure appears to be embedded in a clear gel- atin material. Finally, computer graphics images of drug–receptor in- teractions, whether taken from x-ray crystal data or in silico generated, provide insight into the binding interactions, as shown in Figure 2.23. A full display of all the atomic cen- ters in a protein structure gives too much detail. Most com- monly, as shown in Figure 2.23, a ribbon structure traces the backbone of the protein main chain.23 The Richardson approach is another commonly used display to highlight secondary structural features, in which cylinders denote �- helices, arrows denote �-sheets, and tubes are used for coils and turns.24 Because drug molecules make contact with solvents and receptor sites through surface contacts, it is paramount to have accurate methods to represent molecular surfaces cor- rectly. Algorithms have been developed for such purposes, and they continue to be improved. The most straightforward way to represent a molecular shape is by the so-called van der Waals surface (Fig. 2.22), in which each constituent atom contributes its exposed surface to the overall molecu- lar surface. Each atom is assigned a volume corresponding to its van der Waals radius, and only the union of atomic spheres contributes. These van der Waals surfaces have small crevices and pockets that cannot make contact with solvent molecules. Another surface, known as the solvent accessible or Connolly surface, can be generated.25 The al- gorithm takes the van der Waals surface and rolls a sphere, having the volume of a water molecule with a radius of 1.4 Å, across it. Wherever the sphere makes contact with the original surface, a new surface is created. This expanded surface is a more realistic representation of what water mol- ecules contact. Another similar solvent-accessible surface is known as the Lee and Richards surface.26 This surface is constructed in an analogous way, with a sphere rolled over the van der Waals surface, but the boundary is taken as a line connecting the center of mass of the sphere from point to point. Also, it is possible to calculate the solvent excluded surface. The polar and nonpolar surface areas can be used as QSAR descriptors, and many computer models for solvation use solvent-accessible surface areas (SASA). Commonly, the electrostatic density may be displayed on the surface of a molecular structure, providing an easily recognized color coded grid that may be used to infer the complementary binding functional groups of the putative receptor. A goal of docking programs is to screen large dataset to locate compounds that appear to have the atomic structure and conformation to dock readily at the receptor. Although there are several software programs available, their ability to differentiate between known ligands and decoys has not reached a level that this approach to searching databases has become standard. In other words, the programs will selected valid ligands and show them docking accordingly with the receptor, but they also docked the decoys and also usually do a poor job of predicting ligand binding affinity.27,28 So challenging is this problem that a database of docking de- coys has been created.29 Figure 2.23 A computer-generated representation of a thienothipyran-2-sulfonamide bound to the active site of carbonic anhydrase. Note that the ribbon has been traced through the protein backbone. Proteins are com- monly displayed this way.
