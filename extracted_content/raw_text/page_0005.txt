example, the large, polar trypanocide suramin remains in the body in the protein-bound form for as long as 3 months (t1/2 � 50 days). The maintenance dose for this drug is based on weekly administration. At first, this might seem to be an ad- vantage to the patient. It can be, but it also means that, should the patient have serious adverse reactions, a significant length of time will be required before the concentration of drug falls below toxic levels. The drug–protein binding phenomenon can lead to some clinically significant drug–drug interactions that result when one drug displaces another from the binding site on albumin. A large number of drugs can displace the anticoagulant war- farin from its albumin-binding sites. This increases the ef- fective concentration of warfarin at the receptor, leading to an increased prothrombin time (increased time for clot for- mation) and potential hemorrhage. Tissue Depots The drug can also be stored in tissue depots. Neutral fat con- stitutes some 20% to 50% of body weight and constitutes a depot of considerable importance. The more lipophilic the drug, the more likely it will concentrate in these pharmaco- logically inert depots. The ultra–short-acting, lipophilic bar- biturate thiopental’s concentration rapidly decreases below its effective concentration following administration. It dis- appears into tissue protein, redistributes into body fat, and then slowly diffuses back out of the tissue depots but in con- centrations too low for a pharmacological response. Thus, only the initially administered thiopental is present in high enough concentrations to combine with its receptors. The re- maining thiopental diffuses out of the tissue depots into sys- temic circulation in concentrations too small to be effective (Fig. 2.1), is metabolized in the liver, and is excreted. In general, structural changes in the barbiturate series (see Chapter 12) that favor partitioning into the lipid tissue stores decrease duration of action but increase central ner- vous system (CNS) depression. Conversely, the barbiturates with the slowest onset of action and longest duration of ac- tion contain the more polar side chains. This latter group of barbiturates both enters and leaves the CNS more slowly than the more lipophilic thiopental. Drug Metabolism All substances in the circulatory system, including drugs, metabolites, and nutrients, will pass through the liver. Most molecules absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract enter the portal vein and are initially transported to the liver. A significant proportion of a drug will partition or be transported into the hepatocyte, where it may be metabo- lized by hepatic enzymes to inactive chemicals during the initial trip through the liver, by what is known as the first- pass effect (see Chapter 3). Lidocaine is a classic example of the significance of the first-pass effect. Over 60% of this local anesthetic antiar- rhythmic agent is metabolized during its initial passage through the liver, resulting in it being impractical to admin- ister orally. When used for cardiac arrhythmias, it is admin- istered intravenously. This rapid metabolism of lidocaine is used to advantage when stabilizing a patient with cardiac arrhythmias. Should too much lidocaine be administered intravenously, toxic responses will tend to decrease be- cause of rapid biotransformation to inactive metabolites. An understanding of the metabolic labile site on lidocaine led to the development of the primary amine analog tocainide. In contrast to lidocaine’s half-life of less than 2 hours, tocainide’s half-life is approximately 15 hours, with 40% of the drug excreted unchanged. The develop- ment of orally active antiarrhythmic agents is discussed in more detail in Chapter 19. A study of the metabolic fate of a drug is required for all new drug products. Often it is found that the metabolites are also active. Sometimes the metabolite is the pharmaco- logically active molecule. These drug metabolites can pro- vide leads for additional investigations of potentially new products. Examples of an inactive parent drug that is con- verted to an active metabolite include the nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agent sulindac being reduced to the active sulfide metabolite, the immunosuppressant azathioprine being cleaved to the purine antimetabolite 6-mercaptopurine, and purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites and antiviral Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 7
