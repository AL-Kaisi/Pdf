nitrogen would be 5 valence electrons minus 2 hydrogens, or 3. There are various additional modifications that are done to further differentiate atoms and define their envi- ronments within the molecule. Excellent regression equations using topological indices have been obtained. A problem is interpreting what they mean. Is it lipophilicity, steric bulk, or electronic terms that define activity? The topological indices can be correlated with all of these common physicochemical descriptors. Another problem is that it is difficult to use the equation to decide what molecular modifications can be made to en- hance activity further, again because of ambiguities in physicochemical interpretation. Should the medicinal chemist increase or decrease lipophilicity at a particular lo- cation on the molecule? Should specific substituents be in- creased or decreased? On the other hand, topological indices can be very valuable in classification schemes that are de- scribed later in this chapter. They do describe the structure in terms of rings, branching, flexibility, etc. Classification Methods Besides regression analysis, there are other statistical tech- niques used in drug design. These fit under the classification of multivariate statistics and include discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, and pattern recognition. The latter can consist of a mixture of statistical and nonstatistical methodologies. The goal usually is to try to ascertain what physicochemical parameters and structural attributes con- tribute to a class or type of biological activity. Then, the chemicals are classified into groupings such as carcino- genic/noncarcinogenic, sweet/bitter, active/inactive, and de- pressant/stimulant. The term multivariate is used because of the wide variety and number of independent or descriptor variables that may be used. The same physicochemical parameters seen in QSAR analyses are used, but in addition, the software in the computer programs breaks the molecule down into sub- structures. These structural fragments also become vari- ables. Examples of the typical substructures used include carbonyls, enones, conjugation, rings of different sizes and types, N-substitution patterns, and aliphatic substitution pat- terns such as 1,3- or 1,2-disubstituted. The end result is that for even a moderate-size molecule typical of most drugs, there can be 50 to 100 variables. The technique is to develop a large set of chemicals well characterized in terms of the biological activity that is going to be predicted. This is known as the training set. Ideally, it should contain hundreds, if not thousands, of compounds, divided into active and inactive types. In reality, sets smaller than 100 are studied. Most of these investigations are retro- spective ones in which the investigator locates large data sets from several sources. This means that the biological testing likely followed different protocols. That is why classification techniques tend to avoid using continuous variables such as ED50, LD50, and MIC. Instead, arbitrary end points such as active or inactive, stimulant or depres- sant, sweet or sour, are used. Once the training set is established, the multivariate tech- nique is carried out. The algorithms are designed to group the underlying commonalities and select the variables that have the greatest influence on biological activity. The predictive ability is then tested with a test set of compounds that have been put through the same biological tests used for the train- ing set. For the classification model to be valid, the investigator must select data sets whose results are not intuitively obvious and could not be classified by a trained medicinal chemist. Properly done, classification methods can identify structural and physicochemical descriptors that can be powerful predictors and determinants of biological activity. There are several examples of successful applications of this technique.8 One study consisted of a diverse group of 140 tranquilizers and 79 sedatives subjected to a two-way classification study (tranquilizers vs. sedatives). The ring types included phenothiazines, indoles, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, diphenylmethanes, and various heterocyclics. Sixty-nine descriptors were used initially to characterize the molecules. Eleven of these descriptors were crucial to the classification, 54 had intermediate use and depended on the composition of the training set, and 4 were of little use. The overall range of prediction accuracy was 88% to 92%. The results with the 54 descriptors indicate an important lim- itation when large numbers of descriptors are used. The inclusion or exclusion of descriptors and parameters can de- pend on the composition of the training set. The training set must be representative of the population of chemicals that are going to be evaluated. Repeating the study on different ran- domly selected training sets is important. Classification techniques lend themselves to studies lack- ing quantitative data.
