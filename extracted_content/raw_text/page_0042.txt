functioning. Although a normal cell would undergo apopto- sis in this situation, the cancerous cells continue to survive and may mutate more readily because the system of genetic checks and balances is no longer in place. The process of apoptosis can occur by both an intrinsic and extrinsic pathway (Fig. 10.2). The intrinsic pathway be- gins when cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria via channels present in the mitochondrial membrane. The state of this channel is controlled by several different pro- teins such that opening is stimulated by the proapoptotic p53 products Bad, Bax, and Bid and closure is stimulated by the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. Opening of the channel releases cytochrome c into the cytoplasm where it combines with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (apaf-1) molecules to form a wheel-like structure of seven spokes known as the apoptosome. This then binds and activates caspase-9, which activates additional caspase enzymes in a cascade fashion. The caspase enzymes cleave numerous pro- teins within the cell, leading to profound morphological changes and cell death. The extrinsic pathway is activated when ligands of the tumor necrosis factor family of proteins (TNF-ï¿½, FasL, TRAIL) interact with the so-called death receptors (FAS, DR3-5, TNFR1) present on the cell surface. This interaction serves to covert procaspase to active caspase-8/10, which is capable of activating the executioner caspases directly, and in this process, the proapoptotic Bid is activated by caspase-8, which opens the mitochondrial channel allowing for the re- lease of cytochrome c. This then functions as it had in the in- trinsic pathway to form the apoptosome. The ability of drugs to kill cancer cells is generally be- lieved to be because of their ability to induce the process of apoptosis. In high-dose therapy, cell death may occur by necrosis but this is also toxic to the patient. In a general sense, the antineoplastics target DNA or the process of DNA repli- cation and stimulate apoptosis but the exact mechanisms by which this stimulation occurs are not known with certainty. The effectiveness of the agents is reduced in cells where apo- ptosis fails to occur properly, and this is a property of many cancer cells.
