ALKALOIDS� 197 continuous controlled release of scopol- amine flows from the drug reservoir through a rate-controlling membrane to maintain a constant plasma level for 3 days. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Transderm- Scop®. OH3 0.0� .CH2OH (—)-Scopolamine Hyoscyamus Hyoscyamus or henbane is the dried leaf, with or without the Stem and flow- ering or fruiting top, of Hyoscyanius ni,'er Linné (Fam. Solanaceae) and contains not less than 0.04% of the alkaloids of hyo- scyamus. Hyoscyamus is the ancient Greek and Latin name formed from 2 Greek words, meaning hog and bean. The plant is poisonous to swine. The plant is an annual or biennial herb (Fig. 8-6) indigenous to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa and is cultivated in the Soviet Union, the Balkans, Belgium, England, and Germany, and, to some ex- tent, the United States and Canada. The biennial form is most generally cultivated in England; the annual form is cultivated on the Continent. The leaves should he gathered when the plant is in full flower and should be carefully dried immediately. Dioscorides mentioned the plant, and under the name of henbane, it has been employed in European domestic medicine from the remotest times. It is mentioned in Anglo-Saxon works on medicine written in the 11th century and in the Arabian Nights. After the Middle Ages the drug fell into disuse but was reintroduced into European medicine about 1760, largely through the efforts of Störck. The alkaloids, hroscyarine and scopol- amine, 0.05 to 0.15%, of which three fourths is hyoscyamine, are the active prin- ciples. USE Hyoscyamus is a parasympatho- lytic, but the crude drug is rarely employed in medicine today. Egyptian henbane, the dried leaves and flowering tops of Hyosjasiius niuticus, yields about 1.5% of total alkaloid, con- sisting largely of hyoscyamine. The plant is indigenous to and cultivated in Egypt. It is also cultivated in irrigated soils of southern California. The drug is used, per- haps entirely, for the extraction of its al- kaloids. Stramonium Stramonium, jimson weed, or James- town weed consists of the dried leaf and flowering or fruiting tops with branches of Datum stramontuni Linné or of its variety tatula (Linné) Torrey (Earn. Solanaceae). it yields not less than 0.25% of alkaloids. The name Datura is derived from the Sanskrit, dlwttura and from the Arabic fatura or ta- tub, the native name; sfrarnoniu?n is from the French Sf ratnoine, meaning stinkweed. The plant is an annual herb that attains the height of about 2 meters. It is indigenous to the region of the Caspian Sea, natural- ized in waste places in Europe and North America, and cultivated in central Europe and South America. The leaves and tops (Fig. 8-7) are collected when the plant is in flower and are carefully dried and pre- served. A few years ago, most of the com- mercial supply was obtained from plants cultivated in Argentina. At present, Eu- rope is again supplying reasonable quan- tities of the drug. The purple stramonium (Datura stra3noniurn var. tatula), which is naturalized in the United States from trop- ical America, is similar to D. stramoniurn, but the stems and flowers are purplish. The active constituents in the 2 plants are alike. Stramonium was grown in England in about the 16th century from seeds obtained from Constantinople. The early settlers
