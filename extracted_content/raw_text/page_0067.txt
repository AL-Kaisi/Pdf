pancreatic cancer, and NSCLC. Gemcitabine is a potent ra- diosensitizer, and it increases the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. The mechanism of action of this fluorine-substituted deoxy- cytidine analog involves inhibition of DNA synthesis and function via DNA chain termination. The triphosphate metabolite is incorporated into DNA inhibiting several DNA polymerases and incorporated into RNA inhibiting proper function of mRNA. Resistance can occur because of decreased expression of the activation enzyme deoxycyti- dine kinase or decreased drug transport as well as increased expression of catabolic enzymes. Drug oral bioavailability is low because of deamination within the GI tract, and the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Metabolism by deamination to 2�, 2�-difluorouridine (dFdU) is extensive. Drug toxicity includes myelosuppression, fever, malaise, chills, headache, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting. CLADRIBINE (2-CHLORODEOXYADENOSINE, 2-CDA, LEUSTATIN) The drug is available in a 10-mg or 10-mL single-use vial for IV use. Cladribine is used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and non-Hodgkin’s lym- phoma. The mechanism of action of this purine de- oxyadenosine analog involves incorporation into DNA re- sulting in inhibition of DNA chain extension and inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. This incorporation into DNA occurs via the triphosphate metabolite active species. The 2-chloro group on the adenine ring produces resistance to breakdown by adenosine deaminase. Resistance to the an- ticancer effects can occur because of decreased expression of the activating enzyme or overexpression of the catabolic enzymes. Oral bioavailability is variable and averages about 50%. The drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; however, CSF concentrations reach only 25% of those in plasma. The drug is selectively activated inside the cell, and intracellular concentrations of phosphorylated metabolites exceed those in plasma. Toxicities include myelosuppression, neutrope- nia, immunosuppression, fever, nausea, and vomiting. FLUDARABINE (2-F-ARA-AMP, FLUDARA) The drug is available as the phosphate salt in a 50-mg vial for IV use. Fludarabine is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The mechanism of action involves the triphosphate metabolite and its inhibition of DNA chain elongation. The 2-fluoro group on the ade- nine ring renders fludarabine resistant to breakdown by adenosine deaminase. The drug is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-adenosine (F-ara-A) after administration. F- ara-A is taken into the cell and subsequently re-phosphory- lated to yield the triphosphate (F-ara-ATP), the active drug species. Resistance can occur via decreased expression of the activating enzymes and decreased drug transport. Fludarabine is orally bioavailable and is distributed through- out the body reaching high levels in liver, kidney, and spleen. The drug is metabolized to F-ara-A, which enters cells via the nucleoside transport system and is rephospho- rylated by deoxycytidine kinase to fludarabine monophos- phate and finally fludarabine triphosphate, the active species. About 25% of F-ara-A is excreted unchanged in urine. Drug interactions include an increased incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity when fludarabine is used in com- bination with pentostatin. Additionally, fludarabine may potentiate the effects of several other anticancer drugs in- cluding cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin. Toxicities include myelosuppression, immunosuppression, fever, nausea, and vomiting. MERCAPTOPURINE (6-MP, MERCAPTOPURINUM, PURINETHOL) The drug is available as a 50-mg tablet for oral use. The pri- mary uses of mercaptopurine are in the treatment of lym- phoblastic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and Crohn disease. The mechanism of action includes incorporation of mercaptopurine into DNA and RNA via the triphosphate metabolite. This incorporation inhibits synthesis and function of the resulting modified DNA or RNA. The parent drug is inactive and requires phosphorylation for activity. Resistance can occur via decreased expression of the activating enzymes or increased expression of the major catabolic enzymes. Oral absorption is generally incomplete (about 50%) and the drug does not enter the CNS in therapeutic quantities. Mercaptopurine is metabolized by methylation, and the methylated product has anticancer activity. Oxidation by xanthine oxidase yields inactive metabolites. The concurrent use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol can en- hance the potency of mercaptopurine by inhibiting its cata- bolic breakdown. The toxicities for mercaptopurine include myelosuppression, immunosuppression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, urticaria, and photosensitivity. THIOGUANINE (6-THIOGUANINE, 6-TG, TABLOID) The drug is available in 40-mg tablets for oral use. Thioguanine is used to treat acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The mechanism of action involves incorporation of the triphosphate into DNA and RNA, resulting in inhibition of processing and function. Intracellular phosphorylation is re- quired for activity and inhibition of purine biosynthesis. Resistance can include decreased expression of the activat- ing enzyme, decreased drug transport, and/or increased ex- pression of catabolic enzymes. The oral absorption of thioguanine is poor, and the drug does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier. Major metabolic pathways involve deamination or methylation. Thioguanine is not a substrate for the enzyme xanthine oxidase in contrast to mercaptopu- rine. Toxicities include myelosuppression, immunosuppres- sion, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea. PENTOSTATIN (2�-DEOXYCOFORMYCIN, DCF, NIPENT) The drug is available in 10-mg vials for IV use. The drug is used to treat leukemias such as hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoblastic leukemia. The mechanism of action involves inhibition of the enzyme adenosine deaminase yielding increased cellular levels of deoxyadenosine and deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP). The increased levels of dATP are cytotoxic to lymphocytes. Pentostatin is a fermentation product of Streptomyces an- tibioticus. Resistance appears to involve decreased cellular transport or increased expression of catabolic enzymes. Acid instability prevents oral administration, and the drug is only administered by IV. The drug is distributed in total body water but does not enter the CNS. The majority of the dosage is excreted unchanged in the urine.
