566 SECTION Ix Special Topics (A) There Are Multiple Sources of Oxygen Radicals in the Body Ionizing radiation (x-rays and UV) can lyse water, leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Transition metal ions, including Cu+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ can react nonenzymi- cally with oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, again leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Nitric oxide (an important compound in cell signaling, originally described as the endothe- lium-derived relaxation factor) is itself a radical, and, more importantly, can react with superoxide to yield peroxynitrite, which decays to form hydroxyl radicals (Figure 45–2). The respiratory burst of activated macrophages (see Chapter 53) is increased utilization of glucose via the pen- tose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 20) to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, and increased utilization of oxygen to oxidize NADPH to produce oxygen (and halogen) radicals as cytotoxic agents to kill phagocytosed microorganisms. The respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) is a flavoprotein that reduces oxygen to superoxide: NADPH + 2O2 → NADP+ + 2•O2 − + 2H+ Plasma markers of radical damage to lipids increase consider- ably in response to even a mild infection. The oxidation of reduced flavin coenzymes in the mito- chondrial (see Chapter 13) and microsomal electron transport chains proceeds through a series of steps in which the flavin semiquinone radical is stabilized by the protein to which it is bound, and forms oxygen radicals as transient intermediates. Although the final products are not radicals, because of the unpredictable nature of radicals there is considerable “leakage “of radicals, and some 3% to 5% of the daily consumption of 30 mol of oxygen by an adult human being is converted to singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide, perhydroxyl, and activated macrophages ionizing radiation Nitric oxide synthase transition metal ions + O2 Mitochondrial oxidation of reduced flavins FIGURE 45–2 Sources of radicals.
