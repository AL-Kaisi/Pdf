The DuPel iontophoresis system showing the connections to which a passive and an active (drug-containing) electrode will be attached. FIGURE 20.2. The Phoresor II iontophoresis system with example electrodes attached. Phonophoresis Phonophoresis (syn, ultrasound, sonophoresis, ultrasono­ phoresis, ultraphonophoresis) is the transport of drugs through the skin using ultrasound; it is a combination of ultrasound therapy with topical drug therapy to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations at selected sites in the skin. It is widely used by physiotherapists. In this tech­ nique, the drug is generally mixed with a coupling agent, usually a gel, but sometimes a cream or ointment, that transfers ultrasonic energy from the phonophoresis device to the skin. The ultrasonic unit has a sound transducer head emitting energy at 1 MHz at 0.5 to 1 W / cm 2. Although
