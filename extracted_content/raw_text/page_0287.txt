Glycemic Targets The American Diabetes Association criteria for acceptable control include an HbA1c of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol), pre­meal glucose levels of 90–130 mg/dL (5–7.2 mmol/L), and peak postprandial glucose of less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). While the HbA1c target is appropriate for individuals treated with lifestyle interventions and euglycemic therapy, it may need to be modified for individuals treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues due to their increased risk of hypoglycemia. Less stringent glycemic control also is appropriate for children as well as patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, significant microvascular and macrovascular disease, other co­morbidities (eg, coronary heart disease), and limited life expectancy. For the elderly, frail patient an HbA1c close to 8% may be appropriate. More stringent glycemic control is appropriate for adult patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, limited comorbidities, and a long life­expectancy. For patients using CGM, the TIR and GMI are used to tailor the diabetes management plan, in addition to the HbA1c. Treatment Treatment must be individualized based on the type of diabetes and specific needs of each patient. A. Type 1 Diabetes In patients with type 1 diabetes, a combination of rapid­acting insulin analogs and long­acting insulin analogs allow for more physiologic insulin replacement. A newly diagnosed patient may require minimal doses of basal and bolus insulins because they still have endogenous insulin production. In patients with longer duration of diabetes, the 24­hour basal insulin needs are usually based on age and body weight. An adolescent might need as much as 0.4 unit/kg/day; young adult (less than 25 years), 0.35 unit/kg/day; and older adults, 0.25 unit/kg/day. The meal bolus varies based on the time of day and the patient’s age. Adolescents and young adults usually require 1 unit per 10 g of carbohydrate. Older adults usually require about 1 unit for 15 g of carbohydrate. The correction factor—how much insulin is needed to lower glucose levels by 50 mg/dL—can be calculated from the insulin­to­ carbohydrate ratios. For example, if 1 unit is required for 15 g of carbohydrate, then 1 unit will lower glucose levels by 50 mg/dL. If 1.5 units of insulin is required for 15 g of carbohydrate (that is, 1 unit for 10 g carbohydrate), then 1.5 units of insulin will lower glucose levels by 50 mg/dL and 1 unit will lower glucose level by 33 mg/dL. These are approximate values and should be individualized. Table 41–8 illustrates regimens of rapidly acting insulin analogs and basal analogs that might be appropriate for a 70­kg person with type 1 diabetes. If the patient is on an insulin pump, he or she may require a basal infusion rate of 0.6 units per hour throughout the 24 hours with the exception of 4:00 AM to 8:00 AM, when 0.7 units per hour might be appropriate (dawn phenomenon). The ratios might be one unit for 12 g carbohydrate plus one unit for 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) of blood glucose above a target value of 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L).
