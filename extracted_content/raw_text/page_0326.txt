156 ANSEL'S PHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORMS AND DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS a hypothetical drug that exhibits kinetic behavior exem­ plifying a two-compartment system. Note the initial steep decline of the plasma drug concentration curve. This typi­ fies the distribution of the drug from the central compart­ ment to the peripheral compartment. During this phase, the drug concentration in the plasma will decrease more rapidly than in the postdistributive or elimination phase. Whether this distributive phase is apparent depends on the timing of the plasma samples, particularly in the time immediately following administration. A distributive phase can be very short, a few minutes, or last for hours and even days. A semilogarithmic plot of the plasma concentration versus time after rapid intravenous injection of a drug best described by a two-compartment model system can often be resolved into two linear components. This pro­ cedure can be performed by the method of residuals ( or feathering), shown in Figure 5.16. In this procedure, a straight line is fitted through the tail of the original curve and extrapolated to the Y-axis (the value obtained is B). A plot is then made of the absolute difference values of the original curve and the resultant extrapolated straight line. The slope of the feathered line (-a/2.303) and the extrapolated line (-b/2.303) and the intercepts, A and B, are determined. The following equation describes a two­ compartment system: Equation 5.5 This is a two-exponential equation that describes the two-compartment system. In this scheme, the slope of the line, -a/2.303, obtained from feathering yields the distributive rate of the drug. The slope of the terminal linear phase or elimination phase,-b/2.303, describes the rate of loss of the drug from the body and usually is considered to be a reflection of the metabolic processes and renal elimination from the body. Appropriate phar­ macokinetic formulas allow the clinician to calculate the various volumes of distribution and rates of distri­ bution and elimination for drugs whose pharmacoki­ netic behavior is exemplified by the two-compartment system. Half-Life The half-life (t½) of a drug describes the time required for a drug's blood or plasma concentration to decrease by half. This fall in drug concentration is a reflection of metabolic processes and/or excretion. The biologic half­ life of a drug in the blood may be determined graphically from a pharmacokinetic plot of a drug's blood concentra­ tion-time plot, typically after intravenous administration to a sample population. The amount of time required for the concentration of the drug to decrease by half is con­ sidered its half-life. The half-life can also be mathemati­ cally determined. Recall Equation 5.3 and rearrange the equation as follows: K t Log C0r _e_l _ = Log c0 - Log cp = --� 2.303 r Cr Equation 5.6 Then, if it assumed that Cr is equal to half of, C� Kelt Log c� 2.303 = o.sc� = Log 2 Thus, 2.303 Log 2 0.693 tl/2 Kel Kel Equation 5. 7 Equation 5.8 If this equation is rearranged, the half-life finds utility in the determination of drug elimination from the body, pro­ vided of course that the drug follows first-order kinetics. Rearranging the prior equation, Equation 5.9 First-order elimination rate constants are reported in time-11 for example, minutes-1 or hours-1• Thus, an elimina­ tion constant of a drug of 0.3 hour-1 indicates that 30% of the drug is eliminated per hour. The half-life varies widely between drugs; for some, it may be a few minutes, whereas for others, it may be hours or even days (Table 5.9). Data on a drug's biologic half-life are useful in determining the most appropriate dosage regimen to achieve and maintain the desired blood level. These determinations usually result in recommended TA B L E 5.9.
