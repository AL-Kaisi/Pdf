Acids can be divided into two types, HA and BH�, on the basis of the ionic form of the acid (or conjugate base). HA acids go from un-ionized acids to ionized conjugate bases (Rx. 2.4). In contrast, BH� acids go from ionized (polar) acids to un-ionized (nonpolar) conjugate bases (Rx. 2.5). In general, pharmaceutically important HA acids include the inorganic acids (e.g., HCl, H2SO4), enols (e.g., barbiturates, hydantoins), carboxylic acids (e.g., low–molecular-weight organic acids, arylacetic acids, N-aryl anthranilic acids, salicylic acids), and amides and imides (e.g., sulfonamides and saccharin, respectively). The chemistry is simpler for the pharmaceutically important BH� acids: They are all pro- tonated amines. A polyfunctional drug can have several pKa’s (e.g., amoxicillin). The latter’s ionic state is based on amoxicillin’s ionic state at physiological pH 7.4. The percent ionization of a drug is calculated by using Equation 2.3 for HA acids and Equation 2.4 for BH� acids. % ionization � (Eq. 2.3) % ionization � (Eq. 2.4) A plot of percent ionization versus pH illustrates how the degree of ionization can be shifted significantly with small changes in pH. The curves for an HA acid (indomethacin) and BH� (protonated ephedrine, Table 2.1, reaction m) are shown in Figure 2.4. First, note that when pH � pKa, the compound is 50% ionized (or 50% un-ionized). In other words, when the pKa is equal to the pH, the molar concen- tration of the acid equals the molar concentration of its conjugate base. In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pKa � pH when log [conjugate base]/[acid] � 1. An in- crease of 1 pH unit from the pKa (increase in alkalinity) causes an HA acid (indomethacin) to become 90.9% in the 100 1 � 10(pH�pKa) 100 1 � 10(pKa�pH) ionized conjugate base form but results in a BH� acid (ephedrine HCl) decreasing its percent ionization to only 9.1%. An increase of 2 pH units essentially shifts an HA acid to complete ionization (99%) and a BH� acid to the nonionic conjugate base form (0.99%). Just the opposite is seen when the medium is made more acidic relative to the drug’s pKa value. Increasing the hydro- gen ion concentration (decreasing the pH) will shift the equilibrium to the left, thereby increasing the concentration of the acid and decreasing the concentration of conjugate base. In the case of indomethacin, a decrease of 1 pH unit below the pKa will increase the concentration of un-ionized (protonated) indomethacin to 9.1%. Similarly, a decrease of 2 pH units results in only 0.99% of the indomethacin being present in the ionized conjugate base form. The opposite is seen for the BH� acids. The percentage of ephedrine pres- ent as the ionized (protonated) acid is 90.9% at 1 pH unit below the pKa and is 99.0% at 2 pH units below the pKa. These results are summarized in Table 2.4. With this knowledge in mind, return to the drawing of amoxicillin. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid (HA acid; pKa1 2.4) will be in the ionized carboxylate form, the primary amine (BH� acid; pKa2 7.4) will be 50% protonated and 50% in the free amine form, and the phenol (HA acid; pKa3 9.6) will be in the un-ionized protonated form. Knowledge of percent ionization makes it easier to explain and predict why the use of some preparations can cause Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 15 Figure 2.4 Percent ionized versus pH for indomethacin (pKa 4.5) and ephedrine (pKa 9.6).
