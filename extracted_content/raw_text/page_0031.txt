tation intensive, with the calculation time for obtaining an approximate solution increasing by approximately N4 times, where N is the number of such functions. Until the advent of the high-speed supercomputers, quantum mechanics in its pure form was restricted to small molecules. In other words, it was not practical to conduct a quantum mechanical analy- sis of a drug molecule. To make this technique more practical, simplifying tech- niques have been developed. Whereas the computing time is decreased, the accuracy of the outcome is also lessened. In general, use of calculations of the quantum mechanics type in medicinal chemistry is a method that is still waiting to happen. It is being used by laboratories with access to large- scale computing, but there is considerable debate about its utility, because so many simplifying approximations must be made for larger molecules. To overcome the limitation of quantum mechanics, there has been motivation to develop alternative approaches to calculation conformations of flexible molecules. The rea- son is that manipulation of computer models is much supe- rior to the use of traditional physical models. Mathematical models using quantum mechanics or the more common force field methods (see later) better account for the inher- ent flexibility of molecules than do hard sphere physical models. In addition, it is easy to superimpose one or more molecular models on a computer and to color each structure separately for ease of viewing. Medicinal chemists use the superimposed structures to identify the necessary structural features and the 3D orientation (pharmacophore) responsi- ble for the observed biological activity. The display of the multiple conformations available to a single molecule can provide valuable information about the conformational space available to druglike molecules. Rather than measur- ing bond distances with a ruler, as was done years ago with handheld models, it is relatively easy to query a computer- generated molecular display. Because the coordinates for each atom are stored in computer memory, rapid data re- trieval is achieved. Moreover, the shape and size of a mo- lecular system can be visualized and quantified, unlike the situation with handheld models, when only visual inspec- tions are possible. Exactly how much energy does it cost to rotate torsion angles from one position to the next? Understanding drug volumes and molecular shapes is criti- cally important when defining the complementary (nega- tive volume image) receptor sites needed to accommodate the drug molecule. High-resolution computer graphics that accompany the conformation calculations have revolutionized the way drug design is carried out. Once a molecular structure has been entered into a molecular modeling software program, the structure can be viewed from any desired perspective. The dihedral angles can be rotated to generate new confor- mations, and functional groups can be eliminated or modified almost effortlessly. As indicated previously, the molecular features (bond lengths, bond angles, nonbonded distances, etc.) can be calculated readily from the stored 3D coordinates. Because of ease of calculations relative to quantum me- chanics, medicinal chemists are embracing molecular me- chanics. Force field calculations rest on the fundamental concept that a ball-and-spring model may be used to approx- imate a molecule.20,21 That is, the stable relative positions of the atoms in a molecule are a function of through-bond and through-space interactions, which may be described by relatively simple mathematical relationships. The complex- ity of the mathematical equations used to describe the ball- and-spring model is a function of the nature, size, and shape of the structures. Moreover, the fundamental equations used in force fields are much less complicated than those found in quantum mechanics. For example, small strained organic molecules require greater detail than less strained systems such as peptides and proteins. Furthermore, it is assumed that the total energy of the molecule is a summation of the individual energy components, as outlined in Equation 2.18. In other words, the total energy (Etotal) is divided into energy components, which are attributed to bond stretching (Estretching), angle bending (Ebending), nonbonded interactions (Enonbonded), torsion interactions (Etorsion), and coupled energy terms (Ecross-terms). The cross-terms combine two interrelated motions (bend–stretch, stretch–stretch, tor- sion–stretch, etc.). The division of the total energy into terms associated with distortions from equilibrium values is the way most chemists and biological scientists tend to think about molecules. Etotal � �bondsEstretching � �anglesEbending � �nonbonded(EVDW � Eelectrostatics) � �dihedralsEtorsion � �Ecross-terms (Eq. 2.18) Each atom is defined (parameterized) in terms of these energy terms. What this means is that the validity of molec- ular mechanics depends on the accuracy of the parameteri- zation process. Historically, saturated hydrocarbons have proved easy to parameterize, followed by selective het- eroatoms such as ether oxygens and amines. Unsaturated systems, including aromaticity, caused problems because of the delocalization of the electrons, but this seems to have been solved. Charged atoms such as the carboxylate anion and protonated amine can prove to be a real problem, par- ticularly if the charge is delocalized. Nevertheless, molecu- lar mechanics is being used increasingly by medicinal chemists to gain a better understanding of the preferred conformation of drug molecules and the macromolecules that compose a receptor. The computer programs are read- ily available and run on relatively inexpensive, but power- ful, desktop computers. The only way to test the validity of the outcome from either quantum or molecular mechanics calculations is to compare the calculated structure or property with actual experimental data. Obviously, crystallographic data provide a reliable measure of the accuracy of at least one of the low- energy conformers. Because that is not always feasible, other physical chemical measurements are used for compar- ison. These include comparing calculated vibrational ener- gies, heats of formation, dipole moments, and relative conformational energies with measured values. When re- sults are inconsistent, the parameter values are adjusted. This readjustment of the parameters is analogous to the frag- ment approach for calculating octanol/water partition coef- ficients. The values for the fragments and the accompanying correction factors are determined by comparing calculated partition coefficients with a large population of experimen- tally determined partition coefficients.
