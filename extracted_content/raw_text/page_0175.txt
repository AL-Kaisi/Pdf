236� ALKALOIDS Both act as cerebral vasoconstrictors; caf- feine is believed to enhance the action of ergotamine. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Ca(ergot, Wigraine. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is the salt of a semisynthetic alkaloid prepared from ergotamine by hydrogenation of the double bond in the lysergic acid nucleus. Dihydroergotamine is employed in the treatment of migraine because it is more effective and better tolerated than the par- ent alkaloid. The usual dose is, parenter- ally, 1 mg, and may be repeated at 1-hour intervals up to 3 mg. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. D.H.E. 45. Ergotoxine was formerly employed as a reference standard in the form of ergotox- inc ethanesuifonate, which was discontin- ued because it was a variable mixture of 3 closely related alkaloids, ergocristine, er- gokryptine, and ergocornine. A mixture of equal parts of these component alkaloids is hydrogenated to eliminate the A9 double bond of the lysergic acid nucleus and to yield an equivalent mixture of dihydroer- gocristine, dihydroergokrvptine, and di- hydroergocornine. The methanesulfonates of this mixture, known as ergoloid mesy- lates, are marketed for the treatment of se- lected symptoms in elderly patients. They produce vasorelaxation, increased cerebral blood flow, lowering of systemic blood pressure, and bradyrdia. The usual dose is, orally or sublingually, 1 mg 3 times a day. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Hydergine, Hydroloid-G''. Methysergide maleate is the salt of methylergonovine that has an additional methyl group attached to the nitrogen at position 1 of the lysergic acid nucleus. It is prepared by semisynthesis from lysergic acid. Methysergide is a serotonin antago- nist employed in the prophylaxis of vas- cular headache. The usual dose is, orally. 4 to 8 mg daily in divided doses. Time of continuous administration should not ex- ceed 6 months, and there must he a drug- free interval of 3 to 4 weeks after each 6-month course of treatment. The patient should be advised to tak. medication with meals and to notify the physician if cold, numb, or painful hands, leg cramps, abdominal or chest pain, or change in skin color occurs. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Sansert®. Lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD does not occur in nature but is prepared by semi- synthesis. The compound has a 2-fold ac- tion, producing a predominant central sympathetic stimulation that parallels a slight depression. Discovered by A. Hof- mann in 1943 during the course of exper- iments directed toward the s ynthesis of an- aleptics, it is the most active and most specific psvchotoniiinetic agent known. The effective oral dose in humans is 30 to 50 .Lg. [SD is of considerable interest and value in experimental psychiatry. Because of widespread misuse, the drug is avail- able, at this writing, only to qualified sci- entific investigators. Drugs Related to Ergot The active principles of ololiuqui, an an- cient Aztec hallucinogenic drug still used in Mexico for magicoreligious purposes, have been identified as ergot alkaloids. Seeds of ololiuqui, Riven corimbva (Linné) Hallier filius (Fam. Convolvulaceae), as well as certain closely related Ipomoea spe- cies (commonly known as morning glories) and Argyreia species, contain up to about 0.05% of total alkaloids. (+ )-Lysergic acid amide (ergine), the principal psychotomi- metic compound in these species, is accom- panied by (± )-isolysergic acid (erginine), ergonovine, (± )-lysergic acid methylcar- binolamide, and certain clavine alkaloids. Many of these morning glories are widely cultivated ornamentals. The ready availability of their seeds has led to misuse by thrill-seeking teenagers and adults who ingest the seeds to experience hallucina- tions. Needless to say., the practice is dan- gerous because of the extreme potency of the active principles.
