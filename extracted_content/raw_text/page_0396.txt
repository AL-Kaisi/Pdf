Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus 189 Diabetic ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis may be precipitated by infection, acute myocardial infarction or vomiting. The patient who reasons ‘no food, therefore no insulin’ could mistakenly withhold insulin. In the absence of insulin, there is increased lipid and protein breakdown, enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis and impaired glucose entry into cells. The clinical consequences of diabetic ketoacidosis are due to: ● hyperglycaemia causing plasma hyperosmolality, ● metabolic acidosis, ● glycosuria. Plasma glucose concentrations are usually in the range 20–40 mmol/L, but may be considerably higher, although euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis has been described when plasma glucose concentrations are only slightly elevated. Hyperglycaemia causes glycosuria and hence an osmotic diuresis. Water and electrolyte loss due to vomiting, which is common in this syndrome, increases ﬂ uid depletion. There may be haemoconcentration and reduction of the glomerular ﬁ ltration rate enough to cause uraemia due to renal circulatory insufﬁ ciency. The extracellular hyperosmolality causes a shift of water out of the cellular compartment and severe cellular dehydration occurs. Loss of water from cerebral cells is probably the reason for the confusion and coma. Thus there is both cellular and extracellular volume depletion. The rate of lipolysis is increased because of decreased insulin activity; more free fatty acids are produced than can be metabolized by peripheral tissues. The free fatty acids are either converted to ketones by the liver or, of less immediate clinical importance, incorporated as endogenous triglycerides into VLDL, sometimes causing severe hypertriglyceridaemia (see Chapter 13). Hydrogen ions, produced with ketones other than acetone, are buffered by plasma bicarbonate. However, when their rate of production exceeds the rate of bicarbonate generation, the plasma bicarbonate falls. Hydrogen ion secretion causes a fall in urinary pH. The deep, sighing respiration (Kussmaul’s respiration) CASE 2 A 24-year-old woman presented to the casualty department in a coma. The relevant biochemical results were as follows: Plasma Sodium 130 mmol/L (135–145) Potassium 5.9 mmol/L (3.5–5.0) Bicarbonate 10 mmol/L (24–32) Chloride 92 mmol/L (95–105) Glucose 35 mmol/L (5.5–11.1) pH 7.10 (7.35–7.45) PaCO2 3.1 kPa (4.6–6.0) PaO2 11.1 kPa (9.3–13.3) Urine was positive for ketones. DISCUSSION The patient was shown to have type 1 diabetes mellitus and had presented in diabetic ketoacidosis, with hyperglycaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and a metabolic acidosis. CASE 1 A 34-year-old woman with known type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted to hospital following a ‘black out’ while driving. She had recently increased her insulin dose because she felt unwell with ‘flu’ but unwisely had missed two meals during the day. The results of some of her biochemistry tests were as follows: Plasma Sodium 135 mmol/L (135–145) Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5–5.0) Bicarbonate 23 mmol/L (24–32) Urea 5.4 mmol/L (2.5–7.0) Creatinine 100 µmol/L (70–110) Glucose 1.5 mmol/L (5.5–11.1) pH 7.43 (7.35–7.45) PaCO2 5.3 kPa (4.6–6.0) PaO2 12.1 kPa (9.3–13.3) DISCUSSION The blood glucose shows hypoglycaemia, secondary to the patient having increased her insulin dose despite having missed meals. Hypoglycaemia can present with neurological impairment, including impaired memory, loss of consciousness and coma. This can be treated in the emergency situation by giving glucose intravenously to avoid irreversible neurological damage. It is important for patients on insulin to monitor their own blood glucose closely, particularly if they wish to drive.
