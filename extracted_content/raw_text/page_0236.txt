BASIC PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS USED TO TREAT ANGINA Drug Action in Angina The three drug groups traditionally used in angina (organic nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and β blockers) decrease myocardial oxygen requirement by decreasing one or more of the major determinants of oxygen demand (heart size, heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility). In some patients, the nitrates and the calcium channel blockers may cause a redistribution of coronary flow and increase oxygen delivery to ischemic tissue. In variant angina, these two drug groups also increase myocardial oxygen delivery by reversing coronary artery spasm. The nitrates are used for relief of acute episodes of anginal pain and for prophylaxis. Because of their slow onset of action, calcium channel blockers and β blockers are used for prophylaxis. Newer drugs are discussed later. NITRATES & NITRITES Chemistry Diets rich in inorganic nitrates are known to have a small blood pressure–lowering action but are of no value in angina. The agents useful in angina are simple organic nitric and nitrous acid esters of polyalcohols. Nitroglycerin is the prototype of the group and has been used in cardiovascular conditions for over 160 years. Although nitroglycerin is used in the manufacture of dynamite, the formulations used in medicine are not explosive. The conventional sublingual tablet form of nitroglycerin may lose potency when stored as a result of volatilization and adsorption to plastic surfaces. Therefore, it should be kept in tightly closed glass containers. Nitroglycerin is not sensitive to light. All therapeutically active agents in the nitrate group appear to have identical mechanisms of action and similar toxicities, although development of tolerance may vary Therefore pharmacokinetic factors govern the choice of agent and mode of therapy when using the nitrates
