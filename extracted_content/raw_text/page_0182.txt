ALKALOIDS� 243 cine, up to 0.8% in the seed and 0.6% in the corm. USE. Colchicum is a source of coichicine. Coichicine is an alkaloid obtained from various species of Colchicum, usually Col- chicum auturnnale. It has also been found in other genera of the lily family. Coichicine has one amido nitrogen atom. The com- pound lacks pronounced basicity and does not form a well-defined series of salts as do other alkaloids. Nevertheless, it is pre- cipitated by many alkaloid reagents and is conventionally considered an alkaloid. (See Fig. 8-25 for the structural formula.) Coichicine occurs as pale yellow, amor- phous scales or powder that gradually turns darker when exposed to light. It is soluble in water and ether and is freely soluble in alcohol and chloroform. The exact mechanism of action of col- chicine in the treatment of gout is not known. It does inhibit leukocyte migration and reduces lactic acid production by leu- kocytes which results in a decreased dep- osition of uric acid. In addition, there is a reduction in phagocytosis which decreases the inflammatory response. USE AND DOSE. Colchicine is used as a suppressant For gout. The usual prophy- lactic dose is, orally, 500 to 650 g, 1 to 3 times a day; intravenously, 500 g to I mg. 1 or 2 times a day. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Coichicirie is combined with probenecid in the follow- ing: ColBenemid®, Colabid ®, and Pro- ben-C®. The use of colchicine to double chro- mosomes has opened a large field in plant genetics. Any numeric change in chro- mosome number entails a mutation that becomes evident in a number of the char- acteristics of the experimental plant. New varieties of plants of economic and phar- macognostic value may result from further research. The interrelationship between the action of colchicine and mitosis is being investigated in animals; preliminary ex- periments show that injections of colchi- cine can affect the dispersal of tumors; thus, it has been employed experimentally in the treatment of various neoplastic dis- eases. Other Alkaloidal Amine Drugs Khat or Abyssinian tea consists of the fresh leaves of Catha edulis Forskal (Fam. Celastraceae). The plant is a small tree or shrub native to tropical East Africa. It is cultivated extensively in the Ethiopian highlands near Harar and to a lesser extent in other parts of East Africa, in South Af- rica, and in Yemen. Fresh leaves are reg- ularly transported by air to areas distant from the centers of cultivation. The leaves are chewed habitually by many people in East Africa and the Arabian countries to alleviate the sensations of hun- ger and fatigue. Authorities disagree as to the safety of the practice. The Expert Com- mittee on Addiction-Producing Drugs of the World Health Organization does not classify khat as a drug that produces ha- bituation or addiction, but the French gov- ernment considers it a narcotic. Regard- less, khat-chewing is a theologically accepted and lawful custom in Arabian and African countries today. Khat contains a potent phenylalkyl- amine alkaloid called (- )-cathinone. It has pharmacologic properties analogous to those of ( + )-amphetamine and is of similar potency with a similar mechanism of ac- tion, namely, the induction of catechol- amine release from storage sites. The young, fresh leaves that come from the tips of the branches contain the optimum amount of cathinone. In older leaves, it is converted to the weakly active compounds (+ )-norpseudoephedrine (80%) and (- )- norephedrine (20%). This conversion also occurs rapidly during the drying of young leaves. 1CH3 NH, (....).Cathinone
