to altered beta tubulin to which the taxanes no longer bind. Increased water solubility also allows the agent to be admin- istered without the need for Cremophor EL, reducing the chance of hypersensitivity reactions. The current indications for the agent are in metastatic breast cancer in combination with capecitabine after the failure of an anthracycline and a taxane and as monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine. The agent is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 to give over 30 different metabolites. Elimination occurs primarily in the feces (65%) with a smaller amount (21%) occurring in the urine. The terminal elimination half- life is 52 hours. Major toxicities associated with the use of ixabepilone have included peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression occurring as neutropenia. Occurring less frequently are alopecia, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, diar- rhea, and muscle pain. MITOMYCIN C Mitomycin C (Fig. 10.24) was isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus in 1958 by Japanese workers and is considered the prototype of the bioreductive alkylating agents.137–139 Mitomycin is sometimes included as an alkylating agent but is included here because it is a naturally occurring material. The drug contains what would appear to be reactive func- tionalities, including the quinone and aziridine functionali- ties, both or which would be thought to be susceptible to nucleophilic attack; however, the reactivity of these func- tionalities is reduced because of steric and electronic effects in the parent molecule. It was reasoned that selective activa- tion could be achieved in a reductive environment such as that found in an area of low oxygen content. This is known to occur in tumors where the fast-growing cells often grow beyond the blood supply that would normally provide oxy- gen.140 A normal cell would undergo apoptosis under these conditions, but because cancer cells often have their apo- ptotic mechanisms inhibited they continue to survive with little or no oxygen available. Mitomycin C is capable of being activated and alkylating DNA in an anaerobic environ- ment, but there is actually little selectivity for hypoxic cells. Activation can occur enzymatically by both one- and two- electron processes. Reductive enzymes such as NADPH- CYP reductase and DT-diaphorase have been implicated in these processes.141 Involvement of one-electron processes such as those seen for the anthracylines result in redox cy- cling and the production of ROS that may result in DNA damage, but the cytotoxicity of mitomycin C is primarily associated with its ability to alkylate DNA. The hydro- quinone can result from a single two-electron process or a one-electron process followed by disproportionation to give the hydroquinone (Scheme 10.30).142–144 The electrons of the amine are no longer withdrawn by the quinone system and are now free to expel methoxide followed by loss of a proton to give the leuco-aziridinomitosene. This reduction renders positions C-1 and C-10 reactive to nucleophilic at- tack because of the fact that there are leaving groups at- tached, and they are now benzylic positions so that the inter- mediate carbocations can be stabilized. Several pathways are possible from this point, and the specific route is dependent on the conditions in the cell. Shown in Scheme 10.30 is one possible pathway that occurs under more acidic conditions and results in the formation of interstrand and intrastrand cross-links. Protonation of the aziridine is followed by ring opening to give the carbocation, which can be stabilized by resonance involving the hydroquinone system. Nucleophiles on DNA may attack at C-1 with concomitant electron move- ment. This can be repeated in a similar manner at C-10, which allows for cross-linking. There are several other pos- sibilities under different conditions. DNA is alkylated by mitomycin C at both the N-2 and N-7 positions of guanine MITOMYCIN C (MITC, MTC, MUTAMYCIN) Mitomycin C is available in 5-, 20-, and 40-mg vials for IV administration in the treatment of cancers of the stomach and pancreas when other treatments have failed. Other uses have included breast, NSCLC, cervical, bladder, and head and neck cancers. Mechanisms of resistance include in- creased synthesis of nucleophilic detoxifying compounds such as glutathione, decreased expression of activating en- zymes such as DT-diaphorase, and increased efflux by Pgp. The drug is rapidly cleared from the plasma after adminis- tration and widely distributed but does not cross the blood- brain barrier. The parent and metabolites are excreted mainly in the feces with an elimination half-life of 50 min- utes. Adverse effects include dose-limiting myelosuppres- sion, mild nausea and vomiting, mucositis, anorexia, fa- tigue, and interstitial pneumonitis. PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS In the last several years, several new treatment options have become available based on increased knowledge of growth factors and cell signaling. Although these agents have provided great benefit in some cases and their utility is still being determined, it is important to remember that in many cases they are used in combination with more traditional chemotherapeutic agents to achieve a better outcome. The traditional agents are often used in combina- tion as well in attempts to increase success and prevent resistance. 400 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry TABLE 10.2 Functional Groups Yielding Analogous Microtubule Binding in Paclitaxel and Epothilone B Paclitaxel Epothilone B C-15 gem-dimethyl C-4 gem-dimethyl C-1 OH C-3 OH C-9 carbonyl C-7 OH C-5 oxetane-oxygen C-12,13 epoxide oxygen C-3� phenyl ring C-17 thiazole ring Figure 10.24 Structure of mitomycin C.
