554 SECTIOn Ix Special Topics (A) factor in the diet of the chickens was vitamin K, while the cat- tle feed contained dicumarol, an antagonist of the vitamin. Antagonists of vitamin K are used to reduce blood coagula- tion in patients at risk of thrombosis; the most widely used is warfarin. Three compounds have the biological activity of vitamin K (Figure 44–7): phylloquinone, the normal dietary source, found in green vegetables; menaquinones, synthesized by intestinal bacteria, with differing lengths of side chain; and menadione and menadiol diacetate, synthetic compounds that can be metabolized to phylloquinone. Menaquinones are absorbed to some extent, but it is not clear to what extent they are biologically active as it is possible to induce signs of vitamin K deficiency simply by feeding a phylloquinone- deficient diet, without inhibiting intestinal bacterial action. Vitamin K Is the Coenzyme for Carboxylation of Glutamate in postsynthetic Modification of Calcium-Binding proteins Vitamin K is the cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate res- idues in the postsynthetic modification of proteins to form the unusual amino acid γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) (Figure 44–8). Initially, vitamin K hydroquinone is oxidized to the epoxide, Free radical chain reaction PUFA (in phospholipid) TocOH R O2 R TocO Superoxide H2O2 GSH Se GS SG H2O, Vitamin Cred, GSH Vitamin Cox, GS SG Glutathione Peroxidase Phospholipase A2 Catalase Superoxide dismutase O2 – Membranes cytosol OO PUFA OOH PUFA OOH, PUFA OH PUFA H FIGURE 44–6 Interaction between antioxidants in the lipid phase (cell membranes) and the aqueous phase (cytosol).
