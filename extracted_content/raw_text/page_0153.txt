Tubocurarifle chloride or (+)-tubocu- rarine chloride is a white or yellowish white to grayish white, odorless, crystal line powder. It is derived from tube curare and was first isolated by Boehm in 1898 and later by King in 1947. King obtained it from C/iondodendron fornentosurn and con- firmed the structure as a quaternary am- monium compound. It is soluble in water and in alcohol but is insoluble in acetone, chloroform, and ether. Tubocurarine chloride is standardized by the "head-drop" crossover test in rabbits in which groups of animals for testing and for control are used on alternate days (crossover). The standard "head-drop" dose is the least amount of the drug ca- pable of producing muscle relaxation so that the head of the animal drops in a char- acteristic manner. USES AND DOSE. Tubocurarine chloride is employed as a skeletal muscle relaxant to secure muscle relaxation in surgical pro- cedures without deep anesthesia. It is also used to control convulsions of strychnine poisoning and of tetanus; it is an adjunct to shock therapy in neuropsychiatry and a diagnostic aid in myasthenia gravis. Usual initial dose, intramuscularly or intrave- nously, is 200 to 400 p.g per kg of body weight, not exceeding 27 mg, then 40 to 200 p.g per kg, repeated as necessary. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Metubine Io- dide® is a modified tubocurarine product. Opium Opium or gum opium is the air-dried milky exudate :obtained by incising the un- ripe capsules of Pa paver sornniferum LinnC or its variety album DeCandolle (Fam. Pa- pavcraceae). The term opil.Irn is from the Greek opion,. meaning poppy juice; Pa paver is the Latin name for the poppy; somniferurn is Latin and means to produce sleep. The opium poppy is an annual herb with large, showy, solitary flowers that vary in color from white to pink or purple. The color of its seeds is also variable, ranging from blue-black or gray to yellow-white or rose-brown. Plants that produce the lighter-colored seeds have been classified as variety album, but this designation is not employed in modern taxonomic writings. Because of its long history as a cultivated plant, numerous varieties of P. somnferum exist, and their taxonomy is extremely complicated. The plant was first cultivated some- where in the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean region where opium was first produced. Opium was then intro- duced into India (the date is uncertain). Some scholars credit the introduction to Alexander the Great (327 B.C.), others to the Arabs who invaded the Province of Sind in the 8th century. The first recorded cultivation of the opium poppy in India dates from the 15th century, and cultiva- tion began in Macedonia and Persia (Iran) about the middle of the 19th century. The opium poppy is grown commercially now in many countries throughout the world, but production is concentrated in a zone that extends from the Turkish Anatolian Plain to the northern border of Laos. The discovery of the medicinal qualities of opium is lost in antiquity. Theophrastus (3rd century BC.) mentioned it, and Dios-
