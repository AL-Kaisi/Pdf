or develop altered binding sites with lower affinity for these agents. Increased DNA repair mechanisms may also decrease the effectiveness of these agents. There are mechanisms by which double-strand breaks in DNA can be repaired. If for ex- ample a strand break occurs in the late portion of the S phase or in the G2 phase after DNA has been replicated, the sister chromatid can be utilized as a template to make the repair in a process known as homologous recombination without the loss of genetic material. However, if a sister chromatid is not available, then a process known as nonhomologus end joining may be utilized. In this process, after a double-strand break has occurred, exonucleases remove additional base pairs from each strand creating overhangs. If complementary sequences are present in the overhangs, the strands can associate and the missing bases can be filled in. This process, however, results in the loss of some genetic material. ETOPOSIDE (VP-16, VEPESID, TOPOSAR) Etoposide is available in 50- and 100-mg capsules for oral use and in 100-mg vials for IV use. The agent is approved for use in testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. It has also been used in a wide variety of cancers including NSCLC, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s disease, Kaposi sarcoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, neuroblastoma, choriocarci- noma, and epithelial, ovarian, testicular, gastric, endometrial, and breast cancers. Etoposide is one of the few natural prod- uct derivatives that can be administered orally. When given by this route, bioavailability is 50%. Administration by the IV route is also utilized, and the drug is widely distributed when given by either route. The agent is highly protein bound (90%) primarily to albumin. Low albumin levels may lead to an increase in free drug and require a lowering of the dose. The drug does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier at normal doses but does during high-dose therapy. Elimination occurs primarily in the urine with 30% to 40% of an IV dose appear- ing as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life is 5 to 10 hours. Metabolism involves opening of the lactone ring to give the hydroxy acid as the major metabolite. Epimerization occurs at C-3 to give the cis-lactone, which may also undergo hydrolysis to give the hydroxy acid. Glucuronidation and sul- fation of the 4�-OH give products that are inactive. Active metabolites are formed as a result of CYP3A4 mediated ox- idative-O-demethylation of the 3�-methoxy group to give the catechol followed by oxidation to give the quinone.
