150 ANSEL'S PHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORMS AND DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS of the alveoli of the lungs, which in a man covers nearly a thousand square feet, provides rapid absorption and drug effects comparable in speed with those following an intra­ venous injection. In the case of drug particles, their size largely determines the depth to which they penetrate the alveolar regions and their solubility, the extent to which they are absorbed. After contact with the inner surface of the lungs, an insoluble drug particle is caught in the mucus and is moved up the pulmonary tree by ciliary action. Soluble drug particles that are approximately 0.5 to 1.0 mm in size reach the minute alveolar sacs and are most prompt and efficient in providing systemic effects. Particles smaller than 0.5 mm are expired to some extent, and thus, their absorption is not total but variable. Particles 1 to 10 mm effectively reach the terminal bronchioles and to some extent the alveolar ducts and are favored for local therapy. Therefore, in the pharmaceutical manufacture of aerosol sprays for inhalation therapy, the manufacturers not only must attain the proper drug particle size but also must ensure their uniformity for consistent penetration of the pulmonary tree and uniform effects. In certain instances and for local effects, drugs are inserted into the vagina or the urethra. Drugs are usually presented to the vagina in tablet or other form, such as a suppository, ointment, emulsion foam, gel, or solution, and to the urethra as a suppository or solution. Systemic drug effects may result after vaginal or urethral application of drugs following absorption of the drug from the mucous membranes of these sites. I FATE OF DRUG AFTER ABSORPTION After absorption into the general circulation from any route of administration, a drug may become bound to blood proteins and delayed in its passage into the surrounding tissues. Many drug substances are highly bound to blood protein and others minimally bound. For instance, in the bloodstream, naproxen is 99% bound to plasma proteins, penicillin G is 60% bound, amoxicillin is only 20% bound, and minoxidil is unbound. The degree of drug binding to plasma proteins is usually expressed as a percentage or as a fraction ( termed alpha, or a) of the bound concentration (Cb) to the total concen­ tration (C,), bound plus unbound (Cu) drug: Cb Cb a = -�- Cu + Cb cl Thus, if one knows two of the three terms in the equation, the third may be calculated. Drugs having an alpha value above 0.9 are considered highly bound (90%); drugs with an alpha value below 0.2 are considered to be minimally (20% or less) protein bound. Table 5.8 presents approximate serum protein-binding characteristics for representative drugs in the blood under conditions associated with usual therapy. The drug-protein complex, which is reversible, involves albumin, although globulins also participate in the binding of drugs, particularly some of the hormones. The TABLE 5.8.

The binding capacity of blood proteins is lim­ ited, and once they are saturated, additional drug absorbed into the bloodstream remains unbound unless bound drug is released, creating a vacant site for another drug molecule to attach. Any unbound drug is free to leave the bloodstream for tissues or cellular sites within the body. Bound drug is neither exposed to the body's detoxifica­ tion (metabolism) processes nor filtered through the renal glomeruli. Bound drug is therefore referred to as the inac­ tive portion in the blood, and unbound drug, with its ability to penetrate cells, is termed the active blood portion. The bound portion of drug serves as a reservoir or depot from which the drug is released as the free form when the level of free drug in the blood no longer is adequate to ensure pro­ tein saturation. The free drug may be only slowly released, which prolongs the drug's stay in the body. For this reason, a drug that is highly protein bound may remain in the body longer and require less frequent dosage than another drug that is only slightly protein bound and remains in the body for only a short period. Evidence suggests that the concen­ tration of serum albumin decreases about 20% in the elderly.
