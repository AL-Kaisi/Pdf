Phvsostigmine salicylate is a cholinergic (ophthalmic) and is admin- istered topically, 0.1 ml of a 0.25 to 0.5% solution, to the conjunctiva I to 4 times i day. Because it prolongs and exaggerates the effect of acetylcholine, physostigmine salicylate is given by injection as an anti- dote in poisonings caused by anticholin- ergic agents. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. For ophthalmic use, Isopto Eserine; for poisoning anti- dote, Antilirium®. Physostigmine sulfate or eserine sulfate is the sulfate of the alkaloid, physostig- mine. This white, microcrystalline powder is deliquescent in moist air and acquires the red tint previousl y described. Storage re- quirements are the same as for physosfig- mine and physostigmirie salicylate. It is a cholinergic (ophthalmic) used in the form of a 025% ointment that is applied topi- cally to the conjunctiva up to 3 times a day. Ergot Ergot, rye ergot, or secale cornutum was formerly defined in the official compendia as the dried scierolium of Claviceps purpurea (Fries) Tulasne (Fam. Clavicipitaceae) de- veloped on plants of rye, Secale cereale Linné (Fam. Grarriineae). Ergot was re- quired to yield not less than 0.15% of the total alkaloids of ergot calculated as ergo- toxine and water-soluble alkaloids equiv- alent to not less than 0.01% of ergonovine. The generic name, Claviceps, refers to the clublike character of the scierotium, pur- puren refers to its purple color. Because these sderotia are long and somewhat pointed, the common name of spurred rye has been applied to the drug. Because galenic preparations of the crude drug are seldom employed in phar- macy in this country, ergot has been omit-
