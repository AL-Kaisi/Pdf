Conformationally rigid acetylcholine-like molecules have been used to study the relationships between these var- ious possible conformations of acetylcholine and their bio- logical effects (Fig. 2.16). (�)-trans-2-Acetoxycyclopropyl trimethylammonium iodide, in which the quaternary nitro- gen atom and acetoxyl groups are held apart in a conforma- tion approximating that of the extended conformation of acetylcholine, was about five times more active than acetyl- choline in its muscarinic effect on dog blood pressure and was as active as acetylcholine in its muscarinic effect on the guinea pig ileum.18 The (�)-trans-isomer was hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase at a rate equal to the rate of hydrol- ysis of acetylcholine. It was inactive as a nicotinic agonist. In contrast, the (�)-trans-isomer and the mixed (�)-cis-iso- mers were, respectively, 1/500 and 1/10,000 as active as acetylcholine in muscarinic tests on guinea pig ileum and were inactive as nicotinic agonists. Similarly, the trans diax- ial relationship between the quaternary nitrogen and ace- toxyl group led to maximal muscarinic response and rate of hydrolysis by true acetylcholinesterase in a series of iso- meric 3-trimethylammonium-2-acetoxydecalins.19 These re- sults could be interpreted as either that acetylcholine was acting in a trans conformation at the muscarinic receptor and not acting in a cisoid conformation at the nicotinic receptor or that the nicotinic response is highly sensitive to steric effects of substituents being used to orient the process. Therefore, internal hydrogen bonds likely play only a secondary role to steric factors in determining the conformational distribution of flexible drug molecules. Conformational Flexibility and Multiple Modes of Action It has been proposed that the conformational flexibility of most open-chain neurohormones, such as acetylcholine, epinephrine, serotonin, histamine, and related physiologi- cally active biomolecules, permits multiple biological effects to be produced by each molecule, by virtue of their ability to interact in a different and unique conformation with different biological receptors. Thus, it has been sug- gested that acetylcholine may interact with the muscarinic receptor of postganglionic parasympathetic nerves and with acetylcholinesterase in the fully extended conforma-
