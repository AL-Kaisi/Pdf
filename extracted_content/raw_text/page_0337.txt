Venous drainage from the mouth into the superior vena cava circumvents first-pass (hepatic) metabolism. Following initial application, the serum tes­ tosterone concentration rises to a maximum within 10 to 12 hours; steady-state levels are usually obtained after the first two Striant systems are used. When removed and not reapplied, the serum testosterone levels fall below the normal range within 2 to 4 hours. and drinking alcoholic beverages on the use and absorp­ tion of testosterone from the Striant system were not spe­ cifically studied but were allowed in the phase 3 clinical studies, and no significant effect was attributed to these activities. What is the effect of food when using Striant? No spe­ cific studies were reported in the package literature. The effects of toothbrushing, mouthwashing, chewing gum, Medicated Gums A medicated gum is a semisolid confection that is designed to be chewed rather than swallowed. Medicated gums release their active ingredient(s) into the saliva and can deliver therapeutic agents for both local action or for sys­ temic absorption. Most medicated gums are manufactured using the conventional melting process of the confectionary
