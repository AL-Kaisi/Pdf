Nevertheless, medicinal chemists can use information from extensive tables of physicochemical parameters to min- imize the number of substituents required to find out if the biological response is sensitive to electronic, steric, and/or partitioning effects.5 This is done by selecting substituents in each of the numerical ranges for the different parameters. In Table 2.6, there are three ranges of B values (�1.23 to �0.55, �0.28 to 0.56, and 0.71 to 1.55); three ranges of MR values (0.92–2.85, 5.02–8.88, and 10.30–14.96); and two main clusters of � values, one for the aliphatic substituents and the other for the halogens. In the ideal situation, sub- stituents are selected from each of the clusters to determine the dependence of the biological response over the largest possible variable space. Depending on the biological re- sponses obtained from testing the new compounds, it is pos- sible to determine if lipophilicity (partitioning), steric bulk (molar refraction), or electron-withdrawing/donating prop- erties are important determinants of the desired biological response. With this background in mind, two examples of QSAR equations taken from the medicinal chemistry literature are presented. A study of a group of griseofulvin analogs showed a linear relationship (Eq. 2.15) between the biolog- ical response and both lipophilicity (log P) and electronic character (�).6 It was suggested that the antibiotic activity may depend on the enone system facilitating the addition of griseofulvin to a nucleophilic group such as the SH moiety in a fungal enzyme. log BR � (0.56)log P � (2.19)�x � 1.32 (Eq. 2.15) A parabolic relationship (Eq. 2.16) was reported for a series of substituted acetylated salicylates (substituted aspirins) tested for anti-inflammatory activity.7 A nonlin- ear relationship exists between the biological response and lipophilicity, and a significant detrimental steric effect is seen with substituents at position 4. The two sterimol parameters used in this equation were L, defined as the length of the substituent along the axis of the bond between the first atom of the substituent and the parent molecule, and B2, defined as a width parameter. Steric effects were not considered statistically significant at position 3, as shown by the sterimol parameters for substituents at position 3 not being part of Equation 2.16. The optimal partition coeffi- cient (log Po) for the substituted aspirins in this assay was 2.6. At the same time, increasing bulk, as measured by the sterimol parameters, decreases activity. log 1/ED50 � 1.03 log P � 0.20(log P)2 �0.05 L(4) � 0.24 B2(4) � 2.29 (Eq. 2.16) At this point, it is appropriate to ask the question, “are all the determinations of partition coefficients and compi- lation of physical chemical parameters useful only when a statistically valid QSAR model is obtained?” The answer is a firm no. One of the most useful spinoffs from the field of QSAR has been the application of experimental design to the selection of new compounds to be synthesized and tested. Let us assume that a new series of drug molecules is to be synthesized based on the following structure. The goal is to test the effect of the 16-substituents in Table 2.6 at each of the three positions on our new series. The num- ber of possible analogs is equal to 163, or 4,096, com- pounds, assuming that all three positions will always be substituted with one of the substituents from Table 2.7. If hydrogen is included when a position is not substituted, there are 173, or 4,913, different combinations. The prob- lem is to select a small number of substituents that repre- sent the different ranges or clusters of values for lipophilicity, electronic influence, and bulk. An initial de- sign set could include the methyl and propyl from the Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 21 TABLE 2.7 Connectivity Table for Hydrogen-Suppressed Phenylalanine Atom O-1 C-2 O-3 C-4 N-5 C-6 C-7 C-8 C-9 C-10 C-11 C-12 O-1 X C-2 X X X O-3 X C-4 X X X N-5 X C-6 X X C-7 X X X C-8 X X C-9 X X C-10 X X C-11 X X C-12 X X
