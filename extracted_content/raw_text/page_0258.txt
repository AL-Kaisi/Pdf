CASE STUDY ANSWER The case described is typical of acute coronary syndrome without STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction). Her chest pain is due to transient and possibly reversible inadequate coronary flow, probably due to rupture of an atheromatous plaque and clotting in an epicardial coronary artery. Immediate treatment to restore coronary flow is indicated. If available, percutaneous coroanary intervention (PCI) is optimal. If PCI is not available in this rural hospital, lysis of the clot should be attempted immediately with a fibrinolytic drug such as alteplase (Chapter 34). Admission to the intensive care unit is indicated, and transfer to a hospital where PCI is available also should be considered if her condition worsens.
