ALKALOIDSï¿½ 215 corides (77 AD) distinguished between the juice of the poppy and an extract of the entire plant. In 1806, Serturner first iso- lated the alkaloid morphine from opium. CULTIVATION, COLLECTION, AND COM- MERCE. The cultivation of the opium poppy is controlled internationally by the Inter- national Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations. At the present time, the only country with a major involvement in the licit production of opium is India, with an estimated production of approximately 750 metric tons (750,000 kg) of opium for 1985. The opium poppy, however, is widely cultivated for the purpose of harvesting poppy seed, the straw being obtained as a by-product and used as a raw material in the production of morphine. The mor- phine is extracted from poppy straw, re- pared by cutting and drying the entire overground plant at a suitable stage of de- velopment. The major producers of poppy straw are Turkey, the Soviet Union, Rou- mania, Australia, France, and Spain. Tur- key, formerly a major producer of both licit and illicit opium, has made it illegal to pro- duce opium and permits poppy cultivation exclusively for the production of poppy straw and seeds. Most of the opium des- tined for the illicit trade originates in re- mote border areas of Burma, Thailand, and Laos, commonly referred to as the "Golden Triangle," and in India, Pakistan, Afghan- istan, and Mexico. For the production of opium in northern India, the poppy seeds are sown in winter in well-cultivated soil. In the spring, when the plants have attained a height of 15 cm, the fields are cultivated, aM the plants are thinned to stand about 60 cm apart. The poppy blossoms in April or May, and the capsules mature in May or June. Each plant bears from 5 to 8 capsules (see Fig. 8-14). The ripening capsules, about 4 cm in di- ameter, change from bluish green to yel- lowish in color. This time is critical for latex collection. The capsules are incised with a knife, which is usually 3-bladed, and the incision is made around the circumference of the capsule. The latex tubes open into one another; therefore, it is not necessary to incise them all. Great skill, however, is required so that the endocarp is not cut. When the endocarp is broken, the latex flows into the interior of the capsule and is lost. The latex, which is at first white, rapidly coagulates and turns brown to blackish. In Rajasthan, each capsule is in- cised 4 or 5 separate times, and it is claimed that the third lancing produces the highest yield of latex. The morning after each lanc- ing, the congealed opium is scraped off with an iron scoop or knife before the heat makes it stick too tightly. Thus each capsuh may be handled 10 times. When sufficiet- latex is collected, it is kneaded into bafl that are wrapped in poppy leaves ant. dried in the shade. Additional processin,, of the raw opium takes place at govern ment collection centers. Rectangular pan. containing about 35 kg of opium Sit in th sun, and every 30 minutes or so each par is stirred with wooden paddles. Eight to 2' days of stirring, depending on the sun, re duces the moisture content from 30% k 10%. When sufficiently dry, it is form'. into 5-kg cakes. Externally, opium is Pat olive-brown or olive-gray. It is more or le. plastic when fresh and becomes hard an, brittle or tough when kept. Internally, it is coarsely granular or nearly smooth, red- dish brown, frequently interspersed with lighter areas, and somewhat lustrous. Its odor is characteristic and its taste is bitter and characteristic. Indian opium is produced in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. At present it is the only licit source of opium. The 5-kg cakes are shipped in polyethylene bags. Indian op- ium yields about 10% of anhydrous mor- phine. Approximately 200,000 kg of opium, with a market value in excess of $5 million, are imported into the United States an- nually. More than 30 different alkaloids have
