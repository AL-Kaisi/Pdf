TABLE 44–5 The Vitamins Vitamin Functions Deficiency Disease Lipid-soluble A Retinol, β-carotene Visual pigments in the retina; regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation (β-carotene is an antioxidant) Night blindness, xerophthalmia; keratiniza- tion of skin D Calciferol Maintenance of calcium balance; enhances intestinal absorption of Ca2+ and mobilizes bone mineral; regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation Rickets = poor mineralization of bone; osteomalacia = bone demineralization E Tocopherols, tocotrienols Antioxidant, especially in cell membranes; roles in cell signaling Extremely rare—serious neurologic dysfunction K Phylloquinone: menaquinones Coenzyme in formation of γ-carboxyglutamate in enzymes of blood clotting and bone matrix Impaired blood clotting, hemorrhagic disease Water-soluble B1 Thiamin Coenzyme in pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases, and tran- sketolase; regulates Cl− channel in nerve conduction Peripheral nerve damage (beriberi) or cen- tral nervous system lesions (Wernicke- Korsakoff syndrome) B2 Riboflavin Coenzyme in oxidation and reduction reactions (FAD and FMN); pros- thetic group of flavoproteins Lesions of corner of mouth, lips, and tongue, seborrheic dermatitis Niacin Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide Coenzyme in oxidation and reduction reactions, functional part of NAD and NADP; role in intracellular calcium regulation and cell signaling Pellagra—photosensitive dermatitis, depressive psychosis B6 Pyridoxine, pyri- doxal, pyridoxamine Coenzyme in transamination and decarboxylation of amino acids and glycogen phosphorylase; modulation of steroid hormone action Disorders of amino acid metabolism, convulsions Folic acid Coenzyme in transfer of one-carbon fragments Megaloblastic anemia B12 Cobalamin Coenzyme in transfer of one-carbon fragments and metabolism of folic acid Pernicious anemia = megaloblastic anemia with degeneration of the spinal cord Pantothenic acid Functional part of CoA and acyl carrier protein: fatty acid synthesis and metabolism Peripheral nerve damage (nutritional melalgia or “burning foot syndrome”) H Biotin Coenzyme in carboxylation reactions in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis; role in regulation of cell cycle Impaired fat and carbohydrate metabolism, dermatitis C Ascorbic acid Coenzyme in hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen synthesis; antioxidant; enhances absorption of iron Scurvy—impaired wound healing, loss of dental cement, subcutaneous hemorrhage Dr.Murtadha AlShareifi e-Library
