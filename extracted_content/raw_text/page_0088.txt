cascade effect, whereby one kinase phosphorylates and ac- tivates more of the next kinase in the pathway amplifying the signal in the process. Stimulation of this pathway re- sults in the activation of several transcription factors in- volved in the expression of growth factors, cyclin D1 (in- volved in controlling cell division, see Fig. 10.1), and transcription factors Fos and Jun, which were first discov- ered as viral oncogenes and are known to be elevated in several human cancers. In addition, overactivation of this pathway may result in loss of contact inhibition, loss of an- chorage dependence, and changes in cell shape, all of which are characteristic of cancer cells. The second major pathway activated by Ras is PI3K- PIP3-Akt/PKB whose activation increases cell proliferation but perhaps most importantly, inhibits apoptosis. When Ras is activated, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-diphosphate (PIP2) is further phosphorylated to give phosphatidylinosi- tol(3,4,5)-triphosphate PIP3, which remains embedded in the plasma membrane but attracts and activates other ki- nases namely protein kinase B (PKB), a serine-threonine kinase. Overactivity of this pathway results in decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and increased cell size. Specific effects include inactivation of the proapoptotic pro- tein Bad (Fig. 10.2) and activation of antiapoptotic NF-�B. The third pathway involves Ras-mediated activation of Ral-GEF (Guanine nucleotide exchange factor), which acts on Ral-A and Ral-B to stimulate their exchange of GDP for GTP and hence their activation. The activation of this path- way, although less well understood, seems to allow cancer cells to metastasize and invade. Overactivity of these pathways is present in several dif- ferent cancers, and consequently, several agents have been developed to correct this. One such approach is the inhibi- tion of kinases whose normal activity has been amplified. Working in Philadelphia in the 1960s, scientists discov- ered a genetic abnormality present in 95% of patients with CML.145 The abnormality was a translocation between chro- mosomes 22 and 9 in which the ABL gene (analogous to the Abelson proto-oncogene found in mice) originally on chro- mosome 9 was translocated to chromosome 22, such that it was fused with BCR gene (breakpoint cluster region). The new chromosome was designated as the Philadelphia translocation or the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1).146 The fusion of these two genes resulted in a protein that encoded the entire ABL gene and as many as three additional pro- teins from BCR. The product of this fusion was found to be a TK that was always activated. This altered TK utilizes ATP to phosphorylate and activate numerous pathways in- cluding MAPK and Akt/PKB along with several others. This leads to proliferation of white cells that normally lasts about a year, when the disease becomes more difficult to treat and eventually to the terminal blast phase lasting several months. Imatinib (Fig. 10.26) was developed to specifically in- hibit this unique TK and does so rather selectively by bind- ing to the ATP-binding pocket and stabilizing an inactive form of the enzyme. Protein kinases have similar struc- tures and consist of C- and N-terminal lobes with the active site formed by a cleft between the two lobes. The activity of the enzyme is regulated by an activation loop that is extended in the active form of the enzyme and provides for substrate binding. X-ray crystal studies of imatinib binding to Abl show that the drug binds in the cleft formed by the two lobes of the enzyme through the formation of several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic in- teractions with the pyridine ring assuming the postion oc- cupied by ATP in the active enzyme.147 Imatinib binding locks the enzyme in a conformation in which the activation loop is oriented so as to block substrate binding. Specificity for the BCR-ABL kinase is not complete be- cause of structural similarity of TKs, and those associated with the PDGF receptor and the receptor for SCF known as KIT are also inhibited (Table 10.3). The agent has been found to be effective in 90% of patients in the chronic stage (the chronic stage last 4–6 years and precedes the proliferation stage mentioned previously). Blast-phase pa- tients respond at a rate of 60% but usually relapse after several months.148 The tremendous success of imatinib led to other agents that could be used in the case of resistance. Specifically, dasatinib can bind to either an active or inactive form of the enzyme and is 100 times more potent compared with ima- tinib. It has the ability to overcome resistance associated with amino acid alterations that leads to decreased affinity for imatinib. As the structure is altered, binding to other TKs (BCR-ABL, PDGF, SRC, KIT) is manifested, which may eventually lead to other indications but at this time, it is used primarily in those cases when patients fail to respond to imatinib.149 This general idea of targeting TKs was extended to the EGF receptor. It was hoped that by targeting EGF TKs the inhibitors would be applicable to a wide range of cancers. Recall that after the receptors dimerize, they transphospho- rylate each other and act as TKs. Currently, there are two structurally similar agents in use, gefitinib and erlotinib, which bind to the ATP-binding site and thereby inhibit the resulting cascade that would normally occur from activation of the EGF receptor.150,151 The benefit of the agents was hoped to be caused by inhibition to the Ras pathway so that ultimately, all three arms could be affected (MAPK, Akt/PKB, and Ral-GEF). The agents are modestly selective for this kinase. Currently both compounds have indications for NSCLC generally as alternatives after the failure of more traditional therapy, and gefitinib has an additional in- dication against pancreatic cancer. Initial results have not been as dramatic as that seen with imatinib. There are also several known mutations and deletions in the EGF receptor of cancer patients and this may affect the activity of these compounds. Specifically, point mutations in the KRAS gene (a member of the Ras family) have been associated with re- sistance to these agents and tests have become available to detect this prior to initiating therapy. The activation of numerous tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases offers many theoretical targets for drug intervention when these pathways become overactive as is often the case in neoplastic cells. These kinase enzymes are all thought to have evolved from a common ancestor and as such possess a great deal of structural similarity that complicates the de- velopment of agents, which are selective for a single kinase. This has led to the strategy of simultaneously inhibiting nu- merous kinase enzymes, and consequently there are several multikinase inhibitors now available. Sorafenib was origi- nally developed using high-throughput testing and parallel synthesis as an inhibitor of the serine-threonine kinase Raf.152 It proved to be a potent inhibitor of this enzyme with an IC50 � 6 nM and acted by stabilizing an inactive form of Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 403
