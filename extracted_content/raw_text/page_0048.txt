reactive platinum compounds such as carboplatin and oxali- platin in which the leaving group was incorporated into a chelate. More recently, there has been interest in the develop- ment of Pt(IV) compounds, which are much less reactive and believed to function as prodrugs requiring reduction to the Pt(II) species prior to reaction with nucleophiles. One such agent, satraplatin is currently in clinical trials. One advantage of these agents is the possibility of oral administration. Satraplatin has shown similar activity when given orally to that of cisplatin given by injection. Tumor cells may become resistant to the platins by mechanisms that are seen with other chemotherapeutic agents such as decreased uptake, increased inactivation by thiol-containing proteins and increased DNA repair. However, a deficiency in a type of DNA repair known as mismatch repair (MMR) has also been implicated in resis- tance to cisplatin and carboplatin.26 The process of MMR in- volves several enzymes that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the genome, and interest has focused on the interaction of these enzymes with repeating units found throughout DNA known as microsatellites. When MMR processes are not operating, these microsatellites may be- come longer or shorter and this is known as microsatellite instability. This can result in frame shift errors such that tumor suppressor genes may become less effective, and the tumor cells therefore fail to undergo apoptosis even if Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 363 Scheme 10.7 Metabolic and chemical activation of ifosfamide.
