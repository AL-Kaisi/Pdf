DNA.18 The conclusion that aziridine is the active alkylating agent once thiotepa has been converted to TEPA is based on the fact that when TEPA is incubated with DNA, no cross- links are formed and only monoadducts are generated. The reactivity of aziridine generated by either route may be some- what enhanced within cancer cells, where the pH is normally reduced 0.2 to 0.4 pH units resulting in an increase in reactiv- ity toward nucleophilic attack. BUSULFAN As an alternative to utilizing aziridines as electrophilic species, it was found that simply utilizing a carbon chain terminated at both ends by leaving groups gave compounds capable of act- ing as cross-linking agents (Scheme 10.9).19 Busulfan utilizes two sulfonate functionalities as leaving groups separated by a four-carbon chain that reacts with DNA to primarily form in- trastrand cross-link at 5�-GA-3� sequences.20 The sulfonates are also subject to displacement by the sulfhydryl functions found in cysteine and glutathione, and metabolic products are formed as a result of nucleophilic attack by these groups to generate sulfonium species along with methane sulfonic acid.21 This is followed by conversion to tetrahydrothiophene, and further oxidation products are subsequently produced to give the sulfoxide and sulfone. The cyclic sulfone known as sulfolane may be further oxidized to give 3-hydroxysulfolane. ORGANOPLATINUM COMPOUNDS There are several organometallic compounds based on plat- inum that play a central role in many cancer treatment protocols (Fig. 10.5). The first of these, cisplatin, was dis- covered by Barnett Rosenberg as a result of experiments in- vestigating the role of electrical current on cell division. Escherichia coli cells in an ammonium chloride solution had an electrical current applied through platinum elec- trodes.22 It was subsequently found that cell division was inhibited but not as a result of the current but from the reac- tion of the ammonium chloride with what was thought to be an inert platinum electrode. Further investigation led to the identification of cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] as the active species and mechanistic studies revealed that after administration of the agent to mammals, the dichloro species is maintained in the blood stream as a result of the relatively high chloride con- centration (Scheme 10.10).23 Movement into the tumor cells is accomplished by passive diffusion or carrier-mediated transport. Once inside the tumor cell, the drug encounters a lower chloride concentration and one chloro group is substi- tuted by a water molecule in a process known as aquation. This serves to “trap” the molecule in the cell as a result of ionization. Reaction with DNA occurs preferentially at the N-7 of guanine of two adjacent guanine residues resulting in primarily (95%) intrastrand cross-links.24 Platinum (II) is considered to be a “soft” electrophile and as a result, its complexes are subject to attack by “soft” nucleophiles such as thiol groups found on proteins. This can result in significant protein binding (88%–95%) and inactiva- tion caused by the presence of thiols in albumin, glutathione, and other proteins.25 Cisplatin administration is also associ- ated with significant nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity that is dose limiting. These factors lead to the development of less 362 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Scheme 10.6 Detoxification of cyclophosphamide by mesna.
