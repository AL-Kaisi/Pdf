ALKAIOiDS� 203 Cocaine and cocaine hydrochloride, as agents of abuse, are generally inhaled or sniffed and are rapidly absorbed across the pharyngeal mucosa, resulting in cerebral stimulation and euphoria. In addition, they are injected intravenously and sub- cutaneously, and cocaine free-base is smoked. Inhalation of the vapors of alka- loidal cocaine, known as "free-basing," has become a popular practice because of the rapidity of onset and the intensity of the euphoric experience. The reason for Con- verting cocaine, hydrochloride to the free amine is that the latter substance volatilizes at about 98°C whereas the salt volatilizes at 195°C, a temperature at which some of the cocaine is decomposed. Since the co- caine is absorbed by pulmonary capillaries and moves from the lungs to the left side of the heart and then directly to the brain, the effects are perceptible in 7 to 10 sec- onds. Repeated use results in psychic de- pendence and tolerance; therefore, cocaine is classified as a Schedule El drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Cocaine served as the model for a large number of synthetic local anesthetics that have been produced to increase the stabil- ity and reduce the toxicity of the natural product. Some of them are vasodilators and are often employed in conjunction with epinephrine. Such compounds are considered in detail in the standard text- books of medicinal chemistry. Biosynthesis of Quinoline Alkaloids Alkaloid Precursors. Tryptophan is a pre- cursor of quinine in cinchona. Because qui- nine is the first secondary compound de- rived from this amino acid to be considered, it is convenient to review the biosynthesis of tryptophan here. The biosynthetic pathway leading to tryptophan in higher plants is unknown; however, it has been elucidated in micro- organisms using auxotrophic mutants of Eschcnch,a coli and Enterobncter aerogenes that required tryptophan for, growth. In the pathway, shikimjc acid, through a series of phosphorylated intermediates, yields chorismic acid, which is an important branch-point intermediate. One branch leads to prephenic acid and the aromatic amino acids, phen ylalanine and tyrosine (see page 112). The other leads to anthra- nilic acid and then to tryptophan. Chor- ismic acid is converted to anthranjlic acid by aromatization and transfer of the amide nitrogen of glutamine. The anthranilic acid then reacts with 5-phosphorihosvl-i-pv. rophosphate to form, via an intermediate, I(o-carboxvphenylamino)1 -deoxyribulose 5-phosphate, which undergoes ring clo- sure to produce indole-3-glycerol phos- phate. The final step in the reaction Se- quence involves replacement of the glycerol phosphate side chain with serine, thereby yielding tryptophan (Fig. 8--9). Quinoline Derivatives. Studies with labeled geraniol and try'ptophan-2-C indicate that quinine is metabolically derived from the monoterpcnoid-tiyptophm pathway that leads to the Conjnanthe-type indole alka- loids (see page 219). The most distinctive feature of quinine biosynthesis appears to be cleavage of the benzopyrrole ring of the trvptophan moiety and rearrangement to form the quinuclidine nucleus and then the quinoline nucleus. Details of the biosyn- thetic processes are lacking, but a pre- sumed biogenetic origin involving stricto- sidine and corynantheal as intermediates QUINOLINE ALKALOIDS Alkaloids containing quinoline as their basic nucleus include those obtained from cinchona (quinine, quinidine, cinchonjne, and cinchonidine) Cinchona and its alkaloids are the only members of this group that are therapeu- tically important at present. Cinchonine, which is isomeric with cinchonjdjne, is the parent alkaloid of the quinine series. Qui- nine and its isomer, quinidine, represent 6-methoxycinc}-pjne
