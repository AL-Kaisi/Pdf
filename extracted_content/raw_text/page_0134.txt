ALKALOD5 -� 195 monium are seldom used m any form other than as the powdered extract, iluidexhuct, or tincture. Most of the alkaloids are derived from Egyptian henbane (Hi/esc/a7nus inutcus Linné). Another important source is Du- boisia, particularly Duboisia n,op-oidc R. Brown and D. 1L'ichnrc/tii F. Moeller. The rel- ative percentages of scopolamine and hyoscyamine occurring in Duboisia depend on the species used, the area in which the plants are collected, and the season of the year. After Duboisia was developed as a source of solanaceous alkaloids (during World War II), I. Smith and H. Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, developed a purely synthetic process for the formation of atro- pine starting with tropine. Although this process was successful, it was not econom- ical; at present, atropine and the related alkaloids are still produced from Dithoisia (see page 199) and from th/oscua,nhts flint ciis (see page 197). Solanaceous Alkaloids The principal alkaloids of this group are (--)-h ' voscyamine,- atropine F( ± ) -hyuscv- aminej; scopolamine (also known as hyo- scine); and the anhydride of atropine tapoatropine) and its stereoisomer, helia- donnine. These are tropine derivatives and esters. Atropine and scopolamine are competi- tive with acetylcholine at the postgan- glionic synapse (muscarinic site) of the parasympathetic nervous s ystem. Clini- cally useful effects obtained from blocking the muscarinic activity of acetylcholine are an antispasmodic effect used principally to relieve spasms of the bowel in the treat- ment of spastic colitis, gastroenteritis, and peptic ulcer; an antisecretory effect used to reduce respiratory secretions in anesthesia (antisialogogue), gastric secretions in pep- tic uicer therapy, and nasal and sinus se- cretions in common cold and allergy med- ications; and a mydriatic and cycloplegic effect used to prevent adhesions between the iris and lens of the eve in cases of iritis Atropine is A, antidote in cases of poi- soning Caused by cholinesterase inhibitors such as physost;.gmine and organophos- phate insecticides. Scopolamine has a depressant activity on the central nervous system and is used to treat motion sickness. It is also employed for preanesthetic sedation and for obstetric amnesia in conjunction with analgesics, and to calm delirium. Toxicity symptoms that can occur during the therapeutic use of atropine, scopola- mine, and heliaclonna tincture are skin rash, skin flushing, mouth dryness, diffi- culty in urination, eve pain, hlurfcd vision, and light sensitivity. The patient should also be advised that such antacids as alu- mina gels ma y interfere with absorption of these drugs when taken simultaneously. Hyoscyamine is the tropine ester of (- tropic acid and is readily hydrolyzed by boiling in dilute acids or alkalies to form these compounds (see Fig. 8-4). The carbon atom n to the carboxyl group of tropic acid is asymmetric and accounts for the natural occurrence of the optical iso- rner. When (- )-hvoscvamine is extracted from the plants in which it occurs, it usu- ally is racemized during the process and thus converted into the ( ± )-compound, which is atropine. The piperidine ring sys- tem of tropine can exist in 2 principal con- formations. The chair form has the lowest energy requirement. In addition, 2 ster- eoisomeric forms can exist because of the rigidity imparted to the molecule through the ethane chain across positions 1 and 5. Pharmacologically, the most active isomer results when the esteratic group is substi- tuted axial at position 3, as in the case of (- )-hyoscyamine and atropine. Hyoscyamine sulfate is the sulfate of an alkaloid usually obtained from species of Heesciao;uc l,inn or other genera of Sol- anaceae. It is extremely poisonous. Hyo- scvamine sulfate occurs as white, odorless crystals or as a crystalline powder; it is del- iquescent and is affected by light. USE AND DOSE Hvoscyamine sulfate is
