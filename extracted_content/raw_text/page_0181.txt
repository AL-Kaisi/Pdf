NHCH, CC—CH, )-Ephedrine Ephedrine sulfate is the sulfate of the alkaloid obtained from the natural sources or prepared synthetically. It occurs as fine, white, odorless crystals or as a powder and darkens when exposed to light. Ephedrine sulfate is used to combat hvpotensive states and for allergic disorders, such as bronchial asthma, as well as for local treat- ment of nasal congestion. The usual dose is, orally or parenterally,.25 to 50 mg, 6 to 8 times a day, as necessary. For external use, intranasally, 0.1 to 0.15 ml of a 1 to 3% solution, 2 or 3 times a day. Ephedrine hydrochloride also occurs as fine, white, odorless crystals or as a bow- der and is affected by light. It has the same pharmacologic properties as ephedrine and is used as a sympatho- mimetic. The usual dose is 25 to 50 mg, every 3 to 4 hours. Both of these salts are readily soluble in water and in hot alcohol but not in ether. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Ephedrine salts are ingredients in the following prod- ucts: Dainite KI, Quadrinal', Tedral, Brorikotahs 5, Bronkai&, and many others. ALLIED PLANTS. In addition to Epl7edra 0 I - CoA---SH ±� HO—C---- H L. 1Phenyl-1acetyIcarbinoI sinica (the source of ma huang) and F. equ- setini Bunge (the chief source of the ex- tracted alkaloid), E. distacjnja Linné also yields ephedrinc. These plants grow in northern China, India. and Spain in sandy and clay soil. Attempts to grow the plants in the United States, particularly in the Da- kotas, were successful but not economi- cally feasible. Cotchicine Colchicum seed is the dried, ripe seed of Coichicu in ant umiiale Lin n6 ( Fam . Lili- aceae). Colchicum corm is the dried corm of the same species. The genus name is from Colchis on the Black Sea, where the plant flourishes; flu- tumna/e refers to the season when the plant blooms. The plant is cultivated in England, central and southern Europe, and northern Africa, where it grows in moist meadows. It is also cultivated as an ornamental in the United States. Two to six flowers with long perianth tubes develop from the corm buds in the fall (hence, the name autumn cro- cus). The seed is collected in July and Au- gust and the corm in the spring before leaf development. Italy and Yugoslavia pro- duce most of the supply of the seed and the corm. Dioscorides mentions a Colchicum. The Arabs recommended the use of the corm for gout in medieval times, but the drug was abandoned because of its toxicity. It again came into use in Europe about the middle of the 17th century, Coichicurn contains the alkaloid coichi-
