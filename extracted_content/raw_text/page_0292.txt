Gliclazide1 channels in beta cells • increase insulin release • Tolazamide, tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, acetohexamide: Older sulfonylureas, lower potency, greater toxicity; rarely used MEGLITINIDE ANALOGS; D­PHENYLANALINE DERIVATIVE Repaglinide, nateglinide Mitiglinide1 Insulin secretagogue: Similar to sulfonylureas with some overlap in binding sites In patients with functioning beta cells, reduce circulating glucose Type 2 diabetes Oral • very fast onset of action • duration 5–8 h, nateglinide • 4 h • Adverse effects: Hypoglycemia BIGUANIDES • Metformin Activates AMP kinase • reduces hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis Decreases circulating glucose Type 2 diabetes Oral • maximal plasma concentration in 2–3 h • Adverse effects: Gastrointestinal symptoms, lactic acidosis (rare) • cannot use if impaired renal/hepatic function • heart failure (HF), hypoxic/acidotic states, alcoholism ALPHA­GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS Acarbose, miglitol Voglibose1 Inhibit intestinal α­glucosidases Reduce conversion of starch and disaccharides to monosaccharides • reduce postprandial hyperglycemia Type 2 diabetes Oral • rapid onset • Adverse effects: Gastrointestinal symptoms • cannot use if impaired renal/hepatic function, intestinal disorders THIAZOLIDINEDIONES • Pioglitazone, rosiglitazone1 Regulate gene expression by binding to PPAR­ γ and PPAR­α Reduce insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes Oral • long­acting (>24 h) • Adverse effects: Fluid retention, edema, anemia, weight gain, macular edema, bone fractures, especially in women • cannot use if HF, hepatic disease GLUCAGON­LIKE POLYPEPTIDE­1 (GLP­1) RECEPTOR AGONISTS • Dulaglutide, exenatide (and exenatide ER), liraglutide, lixisenatide1, semaglutide Analogs of GLP­1: Bind to GLP­1 receptors Reduce post­meal glucose excursions: Increase glucose­ mediated insulin release, lower glucagon levels, slow gastric emptying, decrease appetite Type 2 diabetes, liraglutide only: obesity Parenteral (SubC), (Oral: semaglutide only) • Adverse effects: Nausea, headache, vomiting, anorexia, mild weight loss, pancreatitis, C­ cell tumors in rodents DUAL GIP/GLP1 RECEPTOR AGONIST­4 • Tirzepatide Analog of GIP: Binds to GIP and Reduces post­meal glucose excursions: Increases glucose­ Type 2 diabetes Parental (SC) • Adverse effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss,
