Carbon skeletons of the general types of monoterpenoid precursors of indole alkaloids. also derived from a combination of tryp- tophan and acetate metabolism. Studies with various physiologic strains of Cmvi- ceps species, including some significant stereospecific experiments, have clarified many of the key steps leading to the bio- synthesis of the lysergic acid nucleus. Di- methylallyl pyrophosphate condenses at the 4-position of tryptophan as an initial step in the pathway (Fig. 8-17). Recent evi- dence indicates that the next intermediate arises from the N-methylation of dimethyl- allyltryptophan to give Na -meth yl- dimethylallyltryptophan. The next antici- [� L� j� NH2 H Tryptamine pated step would be decarboxylation, with a subsequent formation of chanodavine-l. The number of intermediates and enzy- matic conversions in these events is still unknown. Concerning the biosynthetic mechanism of alkaloid formation, there is evidence that 2 cis-trans isornerizations in the isoprenoid moiety take place in the course of forming the tetracyclic ring sys- tem. If the trans methyl group of di- methv.lallylpyrophosphate is radioactively labeled, the cis methyl group of chanoclav- inc-I will be labeled indicating one cis-trans isomerization, and the trans methyl group A1maline Coryn ant he-type monoterpenoid precursor Fig. 8-16.
