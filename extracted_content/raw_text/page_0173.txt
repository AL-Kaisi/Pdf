234� ALKALOIDS Ergotamine and the ergotoxirie group are water-insoluble and are often referred to as peptide alkaloids. Significant sernisyn- thetic alkaloids include methylergonpvine, dihydroergotamine, l-1ydergine, methy- sergide, and LSD. The medicinally useful alkaloids, either natural or semisynthetic, are all derivatives. of (+ )-lysergic acid. Because that com- pound is readily converted to its isomer, (+ )-isolysergic acid, the corresponding isolysergic acid derivatives often accom- pany the (+ )-lysergic acid alkaloids in the plant material or are produced during the course of extraction- Isolysergic acid deriv- atives are practically physiologically inert. They are named by inserting an additional syllable, -in, in the name of the correspond- ing lysergic acid derivatives, e.g., ergotam- ine-ergotamifune In addition to its characteristic alkaloids, ergot contains a large number of other con- stituents, including several pigments, a fixed oil (up to 35%), and steroids (ergos- terol). Two compounds that contribute to the physiologic activity of the crude drug are histamine and tyramine. STANDARDS AND ASSAY. Ergot contains not more than 8% of moisture. The use of a cartridge of a nonliquefying, inert, de- hydrating agent to maintain low humidity in the container of ergot is desirable. Ergot is assayed for its alkaloid content by cal- orimetric procedures involving the use of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. USE. Ergot is used as a source of ergot alkaloids. In the past, galenic preparations were used for their oxytocic properties. Ergot Alkaloids Ergonovine maleate or ergometrine maleate occurs as a white or faintly yellow, odorless, microcrystalline powder. It is af- fected by light and is readily soluble in water but less soluble in alcohol. The alkaloid was discovered almost si- multaneously in 1935 by 5 independent re- search groups, and it was assigned 4 dif- ferent names. To resolve the conflict, a fifth name, ergonovine, was officially adopted in the United States. That title has not been accepted elsewhere. Ergometrine is used in practically all other countries, except Switzerland, where ergohasine is pre- ferred. Establishment of a clear-cut priority is difficult but, based on the first isolation of a pure compound, it probably should be awarded to ergobasine. Even in the United States, the accepted chemical name of the isolysergic acid isomer of ergoriovine is er- gornetrinine. Because of its ready solubility in water, this alkaloid has marked advantages over the other ergot alkaloids (Fig. 8-23). The oxytocic effect of the drug, either orally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly, is sometimes noted within 5 minutes after giving the dose, and its effect is more marked than that of either ergotoxine or ergotamine However, the vasoconstrictor action is much less marked. USE AND DOSE. Ergonovinc nialeate is an oxytocic and produces much faster stimu- lation of the uterine muscles than do other ergot alkaloids. The gravid uterus is very sensitive to this effect, and small doses of alkaloid can be given immediatel y post- partum to increase the frequency and am- plitude of uterine contractions as well as to increase the basal tone of the uterine smooth muscle, resulting in a decrease in blood loss from the postpartum uterus. It exerts its effects by acting as a partial ag- onist or antagonist at a-adrenergic, dopa- miriergic, and serotonergic receptors. The usual dose is, orally, 200 to 400 jig, 2 to 4 times a day; intramuscularly or intrave- nously, 200 pg, repeated after 2 to 4 hours if necessary. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Ergotrate Male- ate®. Methylergonovine maleate is a sernisyn- thetic homolog of ergonovine prepared from lysergic acid and 2-aminobutanol. It occurs as a white to pinkish tan, micro- crystalline powder. USE AND DOSE. Methylergonovine male- ate is an oxytocic reputed to be slightly '.
