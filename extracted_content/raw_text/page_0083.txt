non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma as well as rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, Wilms tumor, soft tissue sarcoma, testicular cancer, liver cancer, and head and neck cancers. It has also been utilized in treating pediatric cancer. Vincristine is highly protein bound (75%) and may also bind to platelets that contain large amounts of tubulin. Numerous metabolites have been detected and several have been iden- tified, one of which is the 4-O-desacetyl derivative. The me- tabolism that does occur is believed to largely be mediated by CYP3A. Elimination occurs primarily in the bile with a terminal elimination half-life of 23 to 85 hours. The most commonly seen toxicity for vincristine is a dose-limiting neurotoxicity caused by effects on axonal microtubules. Symptoms are variable and include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, seizure, bone pain, and coma. Constipation is also a commonly seen toxicity, and laxatives may be used prophy- lactically. Other toxicities include alopecia, skin rash, mild myelosuppression, secretion of antidiuretic hormone, azospermia, and amenorrhea. VINORELBINE DITARTRATE (VNB, VRL, NAVELBINE) Vinorelbine ditartrate is available in 1- and 5-mL vials at a concentration of 10 mg/mL for IV use. It is FDA approved for the treatment of NSCLC. The agent has also been used in treating metastatic breast cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, and lung cancer especially in older patients or those with physical difficulties. Vinorelbine is the most lipophilic of the vinca alkaloids because of modifications of the catharanthine ring system and dehydration of the piperidine ring. This allows the agent to be quickly taken up into cells including lung tissue where concentrations are 300-fold higher than plasma concentrations. This is 3 to 13 times higher than the lung concentrations seen with vincristine. The agent is highly protein bound (80%–91%) and metab- olized by CYP3A. The major metabolite seen is the 4-O- desacetyl derivative, which is equally active with the parent but only formed in small quantities. The agent is eliminated primarily (33%–88%) in the bile with some appearing in the urine (16%–30%). The elimination half-life is 27 to 43 hours. The toxicities seen for vinorelbine include myelosuppression, which is dose limiting but ceases upon discontinuation of drug. This is most commonly seen as a neutropenia, and patient’s neutrophil count should be mon- itored prior to and during therapy to decrease the chance of infection. Additional toxicities include nausea/vomiting, elevation of liver function tests, alopecia, generalized fa- tigue, and inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Neurotoxicity is seen with vinorelbine but occurs to a lesser degree compared with other vinca alkaloids because of its decreased affinity for axonal microtubules. Taxanes The taxanes, specifically, taxol (or paclitaxel) was discov- ered in the 1960s as part of a large-scale screening program conducted by the National Cancer Institute on plant ex- tracts.130 Taxol (Fig. 10.22), isolated from the bark of the pacific yew tree, proved to be active against various cancer models; however, interest in the material waned because of the lack of available material and formulation problems. Interest was renewed as the mechanism of action was eluci- dated, new sources of material were identified, and the for- mulation problems were resolved. The formulation problems seen in the early development of paclitaxel were caused by poor water solubility, which was addressed by the use of Cremophor EL and ethanol as vehicles. Cremophor EL is a polyoxyethylated castor oil, and early experience with this formulation resulted in a high percentage of hypersensitivity reactions including rash, bronchospasm, and hypotension, which were associated with the ability of Cremophor EL to cause histamine release. Administration of antihistamines and corticosteroids prior to paclitaxel administration reduces the percentage of patients experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to 1% to 3%.131 The taxanes bind to tubulin at a site distinct from the vinca alkaloids. In the absence of x-ray crystal structures of bound drug, photoaffinity probes of paclitaxel have identi- fied two sites at which binding may occur to �-tubulin. The first site was located at the N-terminus and involved residues 1 to 31. The second site involved residues 217 to 231 of �-tubulin and although these two sites are widely separated in the primary structure, they are close to each other in the tertiary structure.132 The binding site is located on the luminal side of the microtubule and located in the middle of the �-tubulin subunit. Docetaxel binds to the same site with greater affinity. Binding of taxanes at low concen- tration results in stabilization of the microtubule and pre- vents depolymerization. At higher concentrations, polymer- ization is enhanced, and the normal equilibrium between free tubulin and polymer is modified. The taxanes inhibit both treadmilling and dynamic instability, and cells are most affected in the M phase when microtubule dynamics are un- dergoing the greatest change.
