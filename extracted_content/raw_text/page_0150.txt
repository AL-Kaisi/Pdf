ALKALOIDS� 211 causes vomiting; acurninatn refers to the acute apex of the leaf. The plants are low, straggling shrubs, with slender rhizomes bearing annulated wiry roots. C. ipecacuanha is indigenous to Brazil, which furnishes most of the present supply. It has been cultivated to a limited extent in Malaysia and in India. The drug is gathered during the dry season and dried rapidly in the sun for 2 to 3 days. C. acuminata is indigenous to the northern portions of Colombia and extends into Pan- ama and Nicaragua; it is exported from Cartagena and Savanilla. Apparently, ipe- cac was used by the South American In- dians. The drug was first mentioned by a Jesuit friar in 1601. It was introduced into Europe by Le Gras in 1672 and by 1690 was well-known in medicine. Ipecac contains 5 alkaloids (2 to 2.5%). The 3 principal alkaloids are emetine, ceph- aeline, and psychotnne, contained chiefly in the bark which makes up about 90% of the drug. About 40% of starch is present. In Rio (Brazilian) ipecac, the total alka- loid content reaches slightly over 2%, about one-third cephaeline and two-thirds emetine. At the present time, the plants are becoming rather scarce despite the laws of most South American countries that re- quire a portion of the root to be planted when collections are made. Roots that are collected are usually immature, and the total alkaloid content barely reaches the minimum percentage. In Cartagena (Colombia) ipecac and in Panama ipecac, the total alkaloid content reaches 22%. The rhizomes and roots from Nicaragua and Costa Rica yield more than 2.5% of total alkaloids. In these 4 varieties, the ratio of emetinc to cephaeline is some- what constant and is composed of about one-third emetine to two-thirds cephae- line. USES AND DOSE. Ipecac, in the form of a syrup, is used in the treatment of drug overdose and in Certain poisonings. It pro- duces emesis through a local irritant effect on the gastrointestinal mucosa and a cen- tral medullary effect by stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone. The usual dose in adults and children older than one year of age is 15 ml, followed by one to 2 glasses of water and may be repeated once in 20 minutes if emesis does not occur. The syrup should be recovered by gastric Ia- vage if emesis does not occur after the sec- ond dose. Ipecac syrup should not be con- fused with ipecac fluidextract, which is 14 times stronger. Ipecac mixed with opium (as Dover's powder) acts as a diaphoretic. Ipecac syrup is included in poison antidote kits because of its emetic properties (see page 439). Emeline or methylcephaeline is an al- kaloid obtained from ipecac or prepared synthetically by methylation of cephaeline. It was discovered by Pelletier and Magen- die in 1817. Emetine hydrochloride is a hydrated hy- drochloride of emetine. It occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder that becomes yellowish when exposed to light. It is freely soluble in water and alcohol. USES AND DOSE. Emetine hydrochloride is an antiamebic and acts primarily in the intestinal wall and the liver. It inhibits poly- peptide chain elongation, thereby blocking protein synthesis. The usual dose is, intra- muscularly or subcutaneously, I mg per kg of body weight, but not exceeding 65 mg daily, for not more than 5 days. The drug is not administered orally because it pro- duces nausea and vomiting. Emetine hy- drochloride has been used extensively as an antiprotozoan, particularly in the treat- ment of amebic dysentery, pyorrhea alveo- laris, and other amebic diseases. It pos- sesses expectorant and emetic properties. .-..-. H' L HT^C H,CH3 21-10 CH 2 H -. OCH, HN� - OCH Emetine Hydrochloride
