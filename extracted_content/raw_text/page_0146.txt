H2SO, 2H?O ALKALOIDS� 207 parenchymal cells of the middle layers of the bark. Cinchona contains some 25 closely related alkaloids, the most impor- tant of which are quinine, quinidine, cm- chonine, and cinchonidine, and the aver- age yield is 6 to 7%, of which from one half to two thirds is quinine in the yellow barks. In the red barks, cinchonidirie exists in greater proportion; specimen pieces have yielded as high as 18% of total alkaloids. Another constituent of cinchona is cincho- tannic acid, from 2 to 4%, which decom- poses into the nearly insoluble cinchona red, occurring in red barks to the extent of 10%. The red color in cinchona bark is caused by an oxidase similar to the oxidase that causes fruits to darken when cut. If the fresh bark is heated in boiling water for 30 minutes and then dried, it does not be- come red In commerce, cinchona bark is priced on the basis of its total alkaloid content and frequently on its quinine content. USES AND DOSE. Cinchona and its alka- loids have been used in the treatment of malaria fever for many years. Quinine con- tinues to be used for malaria in many parts of the world, but in the United States this alkaloid is utilized primarily in the prepa- ration of effervescent tonic water. Quini- dine is now the principal cinchona alkaloid employed therapeutically. Overdoses of cinchona products result in temporary loss of hearing and in im- paired sight. Ringing in the ears is a symp- tom of toxicity. When these symptoms are produced as the result of continuous use of cinchona or of quinine, the condition has been called cinchonism. Cinchona was for- merly given in doses of 1 g. Cuprea bark is obtained from Remijia purdicana Triana and R. pedunculata Flick- iger (Fam. Rubiaceae), of central and southern Colombia. It has a copper-red color, is hard, compact, and heavy, and contains numerous transversely elongated stone cells and 2 to 6% of alkaloids, of which one third may be quinine. Cuprea bark is a commercial source of quinidine. Cinchona Alkaloids Quinidine is a stereoisomer of quinine and is present in cinchona barks to the ex- tent of 0.25 to 1.25%. It depresses myocar- dial excitability, conduction velocity, and, to a lesser extent, contractility. Qujnjdjne sulfate is the sulfate of an al- kaloid obtained from various species of Cinchona and their hybrids and from Re- mijia pedunculata, or prepared from qui- nine. It occurs as fine, needlelike, white crystals that frequently cohere in masses. It is odorless, has a bitter taste, and dark- ens when exposed to light. It is readily sol- uble in water, alcohol, methanol, and chlo- roform. USE AND DOSE. Quinidine is used to treat various cardiac arrhythmias such as pre- mature atrial, AV junctional, and ventric- ular contractions; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; atrial flutter; and atrial fibril- lation. When administered orally, the peak serum levels are slightly lower with the gluconate and polygalacturonate salt than with the sulfate salt. The usual oral dose for all available salts is 10 to 20 mg/kg/day in 4 to 6 divided doses in order to obtain the average therapeutic serum levels of 3 to 6 g/ml. Toxic reactions occur at levels above 8 ig/ml- The patient should be in- structed to notify the physician if skin rash, fever, unusual bleeding or bruising, ring- ing in the ears, or visual disturbance oc- curs.
