ALKALOIDS� 233 0 .1 needles that are dipped into a spore sus- pension before application to the rye inflo- rescence is the simplest device but requires an adequate supply of inexpensive labor. The same principle is utilized in motor-dri- ven machines with needle-studded inoc- ulating rollers that are mounted on the front of tractors and are capable of inocu- lating 5 to 7 acres of rye per day. Cultured conidiospores are utilized for the inoculum. Much effort has been de- voted to the isolation, development, and selection of the best strains of C. purpurea for field cultivation. Strains capable of pro- ducing about 0.35% of selected alkaloids, principally ergotamine, are now em- ployed. Approximately 6 weeks after inocula- tion, the mature scierotia are harvested. They may be picked by hand or collected by machines developed especially for this Purpose in Hungary and Germany. Scic- rotia not collected in these ways can be harvested with the grain and separated after threshing by sieving, by specific grav- ity, or by electrostatic attraction processes. Ergot must be dried immediately after col- lection and stored properly to prevent de- terioration. The yield of ergot varies considerably, but if the weather has been reasonably fa- vorable and the cultivation has been done well, the yield amounts to 30 to 100 kg or more per acre. If performed by hand, labor involved in collecting and harvesting the ergot amounts to at least 6 hours per kg. This may he reduced appreciably by mech- anization, but a substantial investment in machinery is then required. These factors, coupled with the present low price and lim- ited market for the crude drug, have dis- couraged the field cultivation of ergot in the United States. Although ergot is not cultivated on a commercial scale in this country, the electrostatic attraction process is utilized to separate the naturally occur- ring drug from quantities of grain. The small domestic supply thus obtained is not uniform in quality or quantity. Successful saprophytic production of ergot alkaloids dates from the monumental work, first published in 1948, of Matazo Abe of the Takeda Pharmaceutical Indus- tries in Japan. The principal alkaloids pro- duced by Abe's strains and by other strains of the fungus subsequently isolated by A. Stoll and his colleagues at the Sandoz Com- pany in Switzerland were found to be new ergoline derivatives. These compounds, al- though closely related, proved not to be derivatives of lysergic acid and were des- ignated as clavine alkaloids (see Fig. 8-17). Although their discovery furnished great impetus to the scientific investigation of ergot alkaloid production in saprophytic culture, the clavine alkaloids proved dis- appointing from the pharmacologic and, consequently, from the commercial view- point. Large-scale production of lysergic acid derivatives in submerged culture was fi- nally achieved in 1960 by A. Tonolo, E. B. Chain, and coworkers of the Istituto Superiore de Sanita in Italy. These inves- tigators utilized an artificially viruiented strain of C. pus pali Stevens & Hall, which produced several simple lysergic acid de- rivatives, especially (+ )-lysergic acid methylcarbinolamide, in stirred fermenters containing a suitable medium. Yields reaching up to 6 mg per ml of nutrient me- dium have been obtained in 7 to 10 days. A United States patent covering this pro- cess was assigned by the investigators to Societa Farmaceutici Italia. The alkaloids obtained can be converted to lysergic acid, which is utilized for the semisynthesjs of ergonovine and ergotamine.� - CONSTITUENTS. Ergot contains or pro- duces a large number of alkaloids, the most important of which are ergonovine, er- gotamine, and a mixture of ergocristine, ergokryptine, and ergocornine that has been marketed for many years under the name, ergotoxine. The alkaloids are often separated into 2 groups based on their sol- ubility in water. Ergonovine is the principal component of the water-soluble fraction.
