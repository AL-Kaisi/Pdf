The production of cocaine is ordinarily conducted on a large scale by a number of methods that are similar but not identical. Many of the important steps are protected by patents. Ordinarily, the total bases are extracted, the ester alkaloids are converted to ( - )-ecgonine by acid hydrolysis, and co- caine is synthesized from it by esterifica- tion first with methanol and then with ben- zoic acid. When this procedure is utilized, only the total content of ecgonine deriva- tives in the leaf is commercially significant. Cocaine has multiple central and periph- eral nervous system actions. Over most of its effective dose range, it is a psychomotor stimulant with a strong abuse potential. The action responsible for the rewarding property, and hence the abuse liability, is through a prolongation of dopamine in the synapse by blocking the dopamine reup- take mechanism. When drug access is un- limited ., cocaine has the ability to dominate behavior, reducing other behaviors such as eating and sleeping. It has one of the high- est reinforcing potentials of any drug as measured by breaking point studies and is the drug which animals with unlimited ac- cess are most likely to select repeatedly in preference to food and water, to the point of death. Cocaine hydrochloride is the hydrochlo- ride of the alkaloid cocaine. It occurs as colorless crystals or as a white, crystalline powder. USE. Cocaine hydrochloride is a local an- esthetic. It is applied topically to mucous membrane as a I to 4% solution. Cocaine hydrochloride is an ingredient in Brompton's cocktail, which is widely used to control severe pain associated with terminal cancer. Because of its CNS stim- ulant properties, cocaine counteracts the narcotic-induced sedation and respiratory depression associated with the narcotic an- algesic ingredient (morphine or metha- done) used in the cocktail. It also poten- tiates the analgesic effect. The United States, in the 1980s, is in the middle o( a cocaine abuse epidemic in many major urban areas. Government of- ficials estimate that 75 tons of cocaine come into the United States illicitl y every year.
