Synthetic corticosteroids bind to the same receptors as cor- tisone and hydrocortisone. Often, receptors for the same li- gand are found in various tissues throughout the body. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (see Chapter 26) in- hibit the prostaglandin-forming enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is found in nearly every tissue. This class of drugs has a long list of side effects with many patient complaints. Note in Figure 2.1 that, depending on which receptors contain bound drug, there may be desired or undesired effects. This is because various receptors with similar structural require- ments are found in several organs and tissues. Thus, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combine with the desired cyclooxygenase receptors at the site of the inflam- mation and the undesired cyclooxygenase receptors in the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing severe discomfort and sometimes ulceration. One of the second-generation antihis- tamines, fexofenadine, is claimed to cause less sedation be- cause it does not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The rationale is that less of this antihistamine is available for the receptors in the CNS, which are responsible for the se- dation response characteristic of antihistamines. In contrast, some antihistamines are used for their CNS depressant ac- tivity because a significant proportion of the administered dose is crossing the blood-brain barrier relative to binding to the histamine H1 receptors in the periphery. Although it is normal to think of side effects as undesir- able, they sometimes can be beneficial and lead to new products. The successful development of oral hypoglycemic agents used in the treatment of diabetes began when it was found that certain sulfonamides had a hypoglycemic effect. Nevertheless, a real problem in drug therapy is patient com- pliance in taking the drug as directed. Drugs that cause seri- ous problems and discomfort tend to be avoided by patients. At this point, let us assume that the drug has entered the systemic circulation (Fig. 2.1), passed through the lipid bar- riers, and is now going to make contact with the receptor. As illustrated in Reaction 2.1, this is an equilibrium process. A good ability to fit the receptor favors binding and the desired pharmacological response. In contrast, a poor fit favors the reverse reaction. With only a small amount of drug bound to the receptor, there will be a much smaller pharmacological effect. If the amount of drug bound to the receptor is too small, there may be no discernible response. Many variables contribute to a drug’s binding to the receptor. These include the structural class, the 3D shape of the molecule, and the types of chemical bonding involved in the binding of the drug to the receptor. Most drugs that belong to the same pharmacological class have certain structural features in common. The bar- biturates act on specific CNS receptors, causing depressant effects; hydantoins act on CNS receptors, producing an anticonvulsant response; benzodiazepines combine with the �-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, with resulting anxiolytic activity; steroids can be divided into such classes as corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, progestogens, and es- trogens, each acting on specific receptors; nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agents inhibit enzymes required for the prostaglandin cascade; penicillins and cephalosporins in- hibit enzymes required to construct the bacterial cell wall; and tetracyclines act on bacterial ribosomes. With the isolation and characterization of receptors be- coming a common occurrence, it is hard to realize that the concept of receptors began as a postulate. It had been realized early that molecules with certain structural features would elucidate a specific biological response. Very slight changes in structure could cause significant changes in biological ac- tivity. These structural variations could increase or decrease activity or change an agonist into an antagonist. This early and fundamentally correct interpretation called for the drug (ligand) to fit onto some surface (the receptor) that had fairly strict structural requirements for proper binding of the drug. The initial receptor model was based on a rigid lock-and-key concept, with the drug (key) fitting into a receptor (lock). It has been used to explain why certain structural attributes pro- duce a predictable pharmacological action. This model still is useful, although one must realize that both the drug and the receptor can have considerable flexibility. Molecular graph- ics, using programs that calculate the preferred conformations of drug and receptor, show that the receptor can undergo an adjustment in 3D structure when the drug makes contact. Using space-age language, the drug docks with the receptor. More complex receptors now are being isolated, char- acterized, and cloned. The first receptors to be isolated and characterized were the reactive and regulatory sites on enzymes. Acetylcholinesterase, dihydrofolate reductase, an- giotensin, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease-converting enzyme are examples of enzymes whose active sites (the receptors) have been modeled. Most drug re- ceptors probably are receptors for natural ligands used to reg- ulate cellular biochemistry and function and to communicate between cells. Receptors include a relatively small region of a macromolecule, which may be an isolatable enzyme, a structural and functional component of a cell membrane, or a specific intracellular substance such as a protein or nucleic acid. Specific regions of these macromolecules are visual- ized as being oriented in space in a manner that permits their functional groups to interact with the complementary func- tional groups of the drug. This interaction initiates changes in structure and function of the macromolecule, which lead ul- timately to the observable biological response. The concept of spatially oriented functional areas forming a receptor leads directly to specific structural requirements for functional groups of a drug, which must complement the receptor. It now is possible to isolate membrane-bound receptors, although it still is difficult to elucidate their structural chem- istry, because once separated from the cell membranes, these receptors may lose their native shape. This is because the membrane is required to hold the receptor in its correct tertiary structure. One method of receptor isolation is affin- ity chromatography. In this technique, a ligand, often an al- tered drug molecule known to combine with the receptor, is attached to a chromatographic support phase. A solution containing the desired receptor is passed over this column. The receptor will combine with the ligand. It is common to add a chemically reactive grouping to the drug, resulting in the receptor and drug covalently binding with each other. The drug–receptor complex is washed from the column and then characterized further. A more recent technique uses recombinant DNA. The gene for the receptor is located and cloned. It is transferred into a bacterium, yeast, or animal, which then produces the receptor in large enough quantities to permit further study. Sometimes it is possible to determine the DNA sequence of the cloned gene. By using the genetic code for amino acids, the amino acid sequence of the protein component of the receptor can be determined, and the receptor then modeled, Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 9
