14 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry hydrochloric acid, a Ka of 1.26 � 106 means that the product of the molar concentrations of the conjugate acid, [H3O�], and the conjugate base, [Cl�], is huge relative to the denomi- nator term, [HCl]. In other words, there essentially is no un- reacted HCl left in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. At the other extreme is ephedrine HCl with a pKa of 9.6 or a Ka of 2.51 � 10�10. Here, the denominator representing the concentration of ephedrine HCl greatly predominates over that of the products, which, in this example, is ephedrine (conjugate base) and H3O� (conjugate acid). In other words, the protonated form of ephedrine is a very poor proton donor. It holds onto the proton. Free ephedrine (the conjugate base in this reaction) is an excellent proton acceptor. A general rule for determining whether a chemical is strong or weak acid or base is • pKa �2: strong acid; conjugate base has no meaningful basic properties in water • pKa 4 to 6: weak acid; weak conjugate base • pKa 8 to 10: very weak acid; conjugate base getting stronger • pKa �12: essentially no acidic properties in water; strong conjugate base This delineation is only approximate. Other properties also become important when considering cautions in handling acids and bases. Phenol has a pKa of 9.9, slightly less than that of ephedrine HCl. Why is phenol considered corrosive to the skin, whereas ephedrine HCl or free ephedrine is considered innocuous when applied to the skin? Phenol has the ability to partition through the normally pro- tective lipid layers of the skin. Because of this property, this extremely weak acid has carried the name carbolic acid. Thus, the pKa simply tells a person the acid properties of the protonated form of the chemical. It does not represent any- thing else concerning other potential toxicities. Percent Ionization Using the drug’s pKa, the formulation or compounding pharmacist can adjust the pH to ensure maximum water solubility (ionic form of the drug) or maximum solubility in nonpolar media (un-ionic form). This is where understand- ing the drug’s acid–base chemistry becomes important. Note Reactions 2.4 and 2.5: Conj. Conj. Acid Base Acid Base HA(un-ionized) � H2O D H3O� � A�(ionized) (Rx. 2.4) Conj.

What is the ratio of ephedrine to ephedrine HCl (pKa 9.6) in the intestinal tract at pH 8.0? Use Equation 2.2. 8.0 � 9.6 � log � �1.6 � 0.025 The number whose log is �1.6 is 0.025, meaning that there are 25 parts ephedrine for every 1,000 parts ephedrine HCl in the intestinal tract whose environment is pH 8.0. 2. What is the pH of a buffer containing 0.1-M acetic acid (pKa 4.8) and 0.08-M sodium acetate? Use Equation 2.2. pH � 4.8 � log � 4.7 3. What is the pH of a 0.1-M acetic acid solution? Use the following equation for calculating the pH of a solution containing either an HA or BH� acid. pH � � 2.9 4. What is the pH of a 0.08-M sodium acetate solution? Remember, even though this is the conjugate base of acetic acid, the pKa is still used. The pKw term in the following equation corrects for the fact that a proton acceptor (acetate anion) is present in the solution. The equation for calculating the pH of a solution containing either an A� or B base is pH � � 8.9 5. What is the pH of an ammonium acetate solution? The pKa of the ammonium (NH4�) cation is 9.3. Always bear in mind that the pKa refers to the ability of the proton donor form to release the proton into water to form H3O�. Since this is the salt of a weak acid (NH4�) and the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetate anion), the following equation is used. Note that molar concentration is not a variable in this calculation. pH � � 7.1 6. What is the percentage ionization of ephedrine HCl (pKa 9.6) in an intestinal tract buffered at pH 8.0 (see example 1)? Use Equation 2.4 because this is a BH� acid. % ionization � � 97.6% Only 2.4% of ephedrine is present as the un-ionized conjugate base. 7. What is the percentage ionization of indomethacin (pKa 4.5) in an intestinal tract buffered at pH 8.0? Use Equation 2.3 because this is an HA acid. % ionization � � 99.97% For all practical purposes, indomethacin is present only as the anionic conjugate base in that region of the intestine buffered at pH 8.0. 100 1 � 10(4.5�8.0) 100 1 � 10(8.0�9.6) pKa1 � pKa2 2 pKw � pKa � log[base] 2 pKa � log[acid] 2 0.08 0.1 [ephedrine] [ephedrine HCl] [ephedrine] [ephedrine HCl] TABLE 2.3 Representative Ka and pKa Values from the Reactions Listed in Table 2.1 (See the Appendix) Hydrochloric acid 1.26 � 106 �6.1 Dihydrogen phosphate 6.31 � 10�8 7.2 Ammonia (ammonium) 5.01 � 10�10 9.3 Acetic acid 1.58 � 10�5 4.8 Phenobarbital 3.16 � 10�8 7.5 Saccharin 2.51 � 10�2 1.6 lndomethacin 3.16 � 10�5 4.5 Ephedrine (as the HCI salt) 2.51 � 10�10 9.6
