The most lethal compound in this assay was chlorprom- azine, with a BR (LD100) of only 0.00000631 mmol; and the least active was ethanol, with a BR of 0.087096 mmol. In other words, it takes about 13,800 times as many millimoles of ethanol than of chlorpromazine to kill 100% of the test subjects in this particular assay. Plotting BR versus PC (partition coefficient) produces the nonlinear scatter shown in Figure 2.7. Note that com- pounds 1 and 11 lie at a considerable distance from the re- maining nine compounds. In addition to the 13,800 times difference in activity, there is a 33,900 times difference in the octanol/water partition coefficient. An attempt at obtain- ing a linear regression equation produces the meaningless Equation. 2.7 whose equation is: BR � �0.0000 PC � 0.0117 (Eq. 2.7) It is meaningless statistically. The slope is 0, meaning that the partition coefficient has no effect on biological ac- tivity, and yet from the plot and Table 2.5, it is obvious that the higher the octanol/water partition coefficient, the more toxic the compound. The correlation coefficient (r2) is 0.05, meaning that there is no significant statistical relationship between activity and partition coefficient. Now, let us see if the data can be linearized by using the logarithms of the biological activity and partition coef- ficient. Notice the logarithmic terms. The difference be- tween the LD100 of chlorpromazine and ethanol is only 4.14 logarithmic units. Similarly, the difference between chlor- promazine’s partition coefficient and that of ethanol is 4.53 logarithmic units. Figure 2.8 shows the plot and regression line for log BR versus log PC. It is an inverse relationship (Eq. 2.8) between physicochemical property and biological response. Otherwise, the regression equation is excellent with a correlation coefficient of 0.9191. log BR � �1.1517 log PC � 1.4888 (Eq. 2.8) Although there is no statistical advantage to using the log of the reciprocal of the biological response, the positive rela- tionship is consistent with common observation that the bio- logical activity increases as the partition coefficient (or other physicochemical parameter) increases. In interpreting plots such as that in Figure 2.9, remember that biological activity is increasing as the amount of compound required to obtain the defined biological response is decreasing. The equation for the line in Figure 2.9 is identical to Equation 2.8, except for the change to positive slope and sign of the intercept. The cor- relation coefficient also remains the same at 0.9191. log 1/BR � 1.517 log PC � 1.4888 (Eq. 2.9) Partition Coefficient The most common physicochemical descriptor is the mole- cule’s partition coefficient in an octanol/water system.
