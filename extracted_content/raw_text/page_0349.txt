I OTHER NOVEL DELIVERY SYSTEMS Definity is a vial of perflutren lipid microspheres for preparing an injectable suspension. The vial contains components that upon activation yield perflutren lipid microspheres that are used as a diagnostic agent for con­ trast enhancement during echocardiographic procedures; it is administered intravenously. Prior to activation, the Definity vial contains 6.52 mg/mL octafluoropropane in the head space; each milliliter of the clear liquid contains 0.75 mg of a specific lipid blend, 103.5 mg of propylene glycol, 126.2 mg of glycerin, and 6.8 mg of sodium chloride in water for injection. The pH may be adjusted to 5.8 to 7.0 with either sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The perflutren vial must be activated prior to use with a mechanical shaking device (Vialmix). Upon activation, each milliliter of the milky white suspension contains a maximum of 1.2 x 1010 perflutren lipid microspheres and about 150 µL/mL of octafluoropropane. The microsphere particles have an average diameter of 1.2 to 3.3 mm (22). Minocycline hydrochloride (Arestin) microspheres are subgingival sustained-release products containing minocycline hydrochloride in a bioresorbable polymer, poly(glycolide-co-D,L-lactide), or PGLA; it is for profes­ sional administration into periodontal pockets. Each unit dose cartridge delivers minocycline hydrochloride equiva­ lent to 1 mg of minocycline free base (23). Doxycycline hyclate (Atridox) 10% in the Atrigel delivery system is for controlled release in subgingival applications. It is composed of a two-syringe mixing system. Syringe A contains 450 mg of the Atrigel delivery system, which is a bioabsorbable, flowable polymeric formulation composed of 36.7% poly(o,L-lactide) dissolved in 63.3% N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone. Syringe B contains doxycycline hyclate that is equivalent to 42.5 mg doxycycline. Once prepared, the product is a pale yellow to yellow viscous liquid with a con­ centration of 10% doxycycline hyclate in the gel. After pro­ fessional application and upon contact with the crevicular fluid, the liquid product solidifies and allows for controlled release of drug over 7 days. Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum semisynthetic bacteriostatic tetracycline (24). Autoinjection Systems The EpiPen and EpiPen Jr. automatic injectors contain 2 mL of epinephrine injection for emergency intramuscular use. Each latex-free injector delivers 0.3 mg ofEpinephrine Injection, USP, 1:1,000 in a 0.3-mL volume. The remain­ ing 1.7 mL (2.0 to 0.3 mL) remains in the injector after use and is not to be used. Each 0.3 mL of the solution con­ tains 0.3 mg epinephrine, 1.8 mg sodium chloride, 0.5 mg sodium metabisulfite, hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH of the solution to 2.2 to 5.0, and water for injection (25). Both EpiPen autoinjectors are designed as emergency supportive therapy of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and are not a replacement or substitute for immediate medical or hospital care. Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic amine that deteriorates rapidly on exposure to air or light, turning C HAPTE R 20 Novel Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Technologies 567 EPIPEN 2-PAK� I Epinephrine) Au o-lnjecro OJ mg A B FIGURE :Z0.15.

The EpiPen injectors should be checked immediately prior to use, and if there is any evidence of discoloration, they should be replaced. The activation cap on the units should not be removed until ready for use. The EpiPen injector should be stored in the provided tubes, because it is light sensitive, at room tem­ perature; the units are not to be refrigerated. Figures 20.15 and 20.16 show prefilled pen injection systems. Humulin N Pen contains NPH human insulin (rDNA origin) isophane suspension in a disposable insulin deliv­ ery device. It is packaged containing five 3-mL disposable insulin delivery devices containing NPH insulin 100 U/mL. Safe Needle Systems With the implementation of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, which requires the evaluation and implementation of "safer medical devices" as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, new devices will be entering the market to enhance the safety of personnel responsible for injecting medications in patients. Enoxaparin sodium injection (Lovenox) is available in a prefilled syringe with an automatic safety device (26). The device allows the use of normal injection technique; the needle shield is removed; the injection proceeds as usual; and the syringe/needle is removed from the injection site with the finger still on the plunger rod. Next, the syringe/ needle is pointed away from the administrator of the injec­ tion and others, and the safety device is activated by firmly
