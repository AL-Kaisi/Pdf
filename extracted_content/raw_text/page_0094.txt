The agent is given orally and is available in 100-mg cap- sules for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The bioavailability is 43%, and the agent is 71% bound to plasma proteins. Extensive metabolism of the agent occurs to give the O-glucuronide of the hydroxamic acid function and 4-anilino-4-oxobutanoic acid with minimal involve- ment of isozymes of CYP. The metabolites, both of which are inactive, are eliminated in the urine and the drug has a terminal elimination half-life of 2 hours. The most com- monly reported adverse effects are fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. Elevations in glucose and triglyceride levels are commonly seen with the agent. The agent has been associ- ated with thrombocytopenia, an increased risk of clotting re- sulting in pulmonary embolism and possibly prolongation of the QTc interval. ARSENIC TRIOXIDE (AS2O3, TRISENOX) Arsenic trioxide is available in 10-mL vials for IV adminis- tration as second-line therapy in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The mechanism of the agent has not been well characterized; however, work has indicated that the agent may cause the degradation of a pro- tein that blocks myeloid differentiation. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is associated with a translocation in which the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene is fused with the retinoic acid receptor gene (RAR�), and the protein that re- sults from this genetic rearrangement prevents myeloid dif- ferentiation.166 Arsenic trioxide is capable of degrading this protein and allowing the cells to differentiate. Additional ef- fects have included stimulation of apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 activity and stimulation of caspase enzymes and p53. Angiogenesis is inhibited by the inhibition of VEGF at the protein level.167 The agent is widely distributed after IV ad- ministration; however, the pharmacokinetics of the agent have not been well characterized. Metabolism studies have shown that the agent undergoes reduction to trivalent ar- senic followed by methylation to give monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acids, which are eliminated in the urine. Unlike most other antineoplastic agents, myelosup- pression does not occur in fact many patients (50%–60%) experience leukocytosis in which white blood cell count in- creases. APL differentiation syndrome is seen in many pa- tients (30%) and presents as fever, shortness of breath, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural or pericar- dial effusions. This may be fatal and is commonly treated with high-dose dexamethasone upon initial suspicion. The presentation of APL differentiation syndrome are identical for arsenic trioxide and retinoic acid. Additional adverse ef- fects include fatigue, a prolonged QT interval, dizziness, mild hyperglycemia, and mild nausea and vomiting. TRETINOIN (ALL-TRANS-RETINOC ACID, ATRA, RETIN-A, VESANOID) Tretinoin is available in 10-mg capsules for oral administra- tion in the treatment of APL. The mechanism of action in- volves passive diffusion through the cell membrane and then movement to the nucleus where it interacts with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) portion of the PML-RAR� fu- sion protein. Binding of tretinoin allows the cell to differen- tiate and has also been shown to result in the destruction of the PML-RAR� fusion protein. Resistance to tretinoin is problematic and associated with an increase in cellular retinoic acid–binding proteins (CRAPBs) located in the cy- tosol. The complexation with tretinoin prevents movement into the nucleus and may present the drug to metabolizing enzymes that inactivate it. Amino acid mutation of the PML-RAR� protein has also been established as a mecha- nism of resistance. The agent is well absorbed upon oral ad- ministration and highly (95%) protein bound. Metabolism occurs in the liver and several inactive metabolites have been identified including 13-cis-retinoic acid, 4-oxo cis- retinoic, 4-oxo trans-retinoic acid and 4-oxo trans-retinoic acid glucuronide. Elimination occurs in the urine (63%) and feces (31%) with an elimination half-life of 40 to 120 min- utes. Vitamin A toxicity is seen in nearly all patients and presents as headache, fever, dryness of the skin, skin rash, mucositis, and peripheral edema. APL differentiation syn- drome such as that seen for arsenic trioxide also occurs. Cardiovascular effects include flushing, hypotension, CHF, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported but occur only rarely. There are also several CNS and GI effects that have been associated with the agent as well. BEXAROTENE (TARGRETIN) Bexarotene is available in 75-mg capsules for oral adminis- tration in the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lym- phoma. The agent is also available as a gel that may be used topically. The mechanism of action has not been fully estab- lished but is thought to involve binding to retinoid receptors resulting ultimately in the formation of transcription factors that promote cell differentiation and regulate cellular prolif- eration.168 Bexarotene has been demonstrated to activate apoptosis as a result of stimulation of caspase 3 and inhibi- tion of survivin, an antiapoptotic protein that would nor- mally inhibit caspase activity.169 Apoptosis is also stimu- lated because of cleavage of poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase, which is antiapoptotic. Reduced expression of the retinoid receptor subtypes RXR� and RAR� has also been demon- strated for the agent. Absorption is nearly complete after oral administration and plasma protein binding is high (�99%).170 There is extensive metabolism in the liver to give 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo- bexarotene as well as glucuronides of these metabolites and the parent. Elimination occurs via the feces with an elimina- tion half-life of 7 hours. Adverse effects include hypercho- lesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypothyroidism, myelo- suppression, nausea, and skin rash. ASPARAGINASE (L-ASPARAGINASE, ELSPAR, L-ASNASE, CRISTANASPASE) Asparaginase is available in 10-mL vials for intramuscular and IV use in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia.
