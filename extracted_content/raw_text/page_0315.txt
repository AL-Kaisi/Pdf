CHAPTER 5 Dosage Form Design: Biopharmaceutical and Pharmacokinetic Considerations 145 these, most are taken for the systemic drug effects that result after absorption from the various surfaces along the gastro­ intestinal tract. A few drugs, such as antacids, are swallowed for their local action in the gastrointestinal tract. Compared with alternative routes, the oral route is con­ sidered the most natural, uncomplicated, convenient, and safe means of administering drugs. Disadvantages of the oral route include slow drug response (compared with par­ enterally administered drugs); chance of irregular absorp­ tion of drugs, depending upon such factors as constitutional makeup and the amount or type of food in the gastrointes­ tinal tract; and the destruction of certain drugs by the acid reaction of the stomach or by gastrointestinal enzymes. Dosage Forms Applicable Drugs are administered by the oral route in a variety of pharmaceutical forms. The most popular are tablets, cap­ sules, suspensions, and various pharmaceutical solutions. Briefly, tablets are solid dosage forms prepared by compres­ sion or molding that contains medicinal substances with or without suitable diluents, disintegrants, coatings, colorants, and other pharmaceutical adjuncts. Diluents are fillers used to prepare tablets of the proper size and consistency. Disintegrants are used for the breakup or separation of the tablet's compressed ingredients. This ensures prompt expo­ sure of drug particles to the dissolution process, enhancing drug absorption, as demonstrated in Figure 5.11. Tablet coatings are of several types and for several purposes. Some, called enteric coatings, are employed to permit safe passage of a tablet through the acid environment of the stomach, where certain drugs may be destroyed, to the more suitable juices of the intestines, where tablet dissolution safely takes place. Other coatings protect the drug substance from the destructive influences of moisture, light, and air during stor­ age or to conceal a bad or bitter taste from the taste buds of a patient.

Capsules are solid dosage forms in which the drug sub­ stance and appropriate pharmaceutical adjuncts, such as fillers, are enclosed in either a hard or a soft shell, gener­ ally composed of a form of gelatin. Capsules vary in size, depending on the amount of drug to be administered, and have distinctive shapes and colors when produced com­ mercially. Drug materials are released from capsules faster than from tablets. Capsules of gelatin, a protein, are rapidly disfigured within the gastrointestinal tract, permitting the gastric juices to permeate and reach the contents. Because unsealed capsules have been subject to tampering by unscrupulous individuals, many capsules nowadays are sealed by fusion of the two capsule shells. Also, capsule­ shaped and coated tablets, called caplets, are increasingly used. These are easily swallowed, but their contents are sealed and protected from tampering like tablets. Suspensions are preparations of finely divided drugs in a suitable fluid vehicle. Suspensions taken orally generally employ an aqueous vehicle, whereas those employed for other purposes may use a different vehicle. Suspensions of certain drugs to be used for intramuscular injection, for instance, may be maintained in a suitable oil. To be suspended, the drug particles must be insoluble in the vehicle. Nearly all suspensions must be shaken before use because they tend to settle. This ensures both uniformity of the preparation and, more importantly, the administra­ tion of the proper dosage. Suspensions are a useful means to administer large amounts of solid drugs that would be inconvenient to take in tablet or capsule form. In addition, suspensions have the advantage over solid dosage forms in that they are presented to the body in fine particle size, ready for dissolution immediately upon administration. However, not all oral suspensions are intended to be dis­ solved and absorbed by the body. For instance, some antidiarrheal preparations contain a kaolin mixture with pectin or attapulgite. The suspended kaolin or attapulgite acts in the intestinal tract by adsorbing excessive intestinal fluid on the large surface area of its particles. Drugs administered in aqueous solution are absorbed much more rapidly than are those administered in solid form, because disintegration and dissolution are not required. Pharmaceutical solutions may differ in the type of solvent employed and therefore in their fluidity characteristics. Among the solutions frequently admin­ istered orally are elixirs, which are solutions in a sweet­ ened hydroalcoholic vehicle and are more mobile than water; syrups, which generally use a sucrose solution as the sweet vehicle, resulting in a viscous preparation; and solutions themselves, which officially are preparations in which the drug substance is dissolved predominantly in an aqueous vehicle and do not for reasons of their method of preparation (e.g., injections, which must be sterilized) fall into another category of pharmaceutical preparations.
