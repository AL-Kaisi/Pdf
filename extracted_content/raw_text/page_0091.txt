bioavailable and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism gives eight identified metabolites including the N-oxide, which is equally active with the parent. However, the majority of the drug in plasma is present as the parent compound. Sorafenib is highly protein bound (99.5%). The drug is eliminated primarily in the feces (77%) with 19% appearing in the urine as glucuronides (UGT1A1) and has a elimina- tion half-life of 24 to 48 hours. The most commonly seen toxicity is skin rash that normally occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. Other adverse effects include hyperten- sion, fatigue, increased wound healing time, and increased risk of bleeding. LAPATINIB DITOSYLATE (GSK572016, TYKERB) Lapatinib is available in 250-mg tablets for oral adminis- tration and is used in combination with cabecitabine in the treatment of breast cancer for those patients that over ex- press the type 2 EGF-R and who have previously received taxane, anthracycline, and trastuzumab therapy. The type 2 EGF-R is one subtype of this receptor and is also known as HER2 or ErbB-2. The agent is a receptor TK inhibitor tar- geting the ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 subtypes. Binding occurs at the ATP-binding site and thereby prevents phosphoryla- tion and the subsequent activation of other kinase en- zymes. ErbB-1 overexpression occurs in approximately 27% to 30% of breast cancers, while ErbB-2 is over ex- pressed in 20% to 25% of cases.156 The agent has demon- strated IC50 values of �0.2 �M against ErbB-1 and 2 from several different cancer cell lines and dissociates slowly (t1/2 � 300 min) from these receptor TKs.157 The drug is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the efflux transporters Pgp and BCRP. It is also an inhibitor of the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1, which is an organic anion trans- porter.158 The absorption of lapatinib is incomplete and variable after oral administration. The agent is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, with minor contri- butions from CYP2C19 and CYP2C8. Lapatinib inhibits CYP3A and CYP2C8 at clinically relevant concentrations. The agent is highly (99%) protein bound and eliminated primarily in the feces. The half-life of the agent increase upon repeated dosing, taking 6 days to reach steady state that gives an effective half-life of 24 hours. The most com- monly seen adverse effects of lapatinib therapy are skin rash and diarrhea. Skin rash is commonly seen with many of the other TK inhibitors and agents that target ErbB-1. Lapatinib-induced diarrhea is usually mild to moderate. There have been reports of decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction associated with the agent, although this appears to occur only rarely and is reversible upon discon- tinuation of therapy. SUNITINIB MALATE (SU11248, SUTENT) Sunitinib is available in 12.5-, 25-, and 50-mg capsules for oral administration for the treatment of advanced RCC and GIST upon the failure of imatinib. The agent is a multiki- nase inhibitor and has been shown to inhibit PDGF-R, VEGF-R, Kit, RET, and the colony-stimulating factor re- ceptor (CSR-1R). The result of this spectrum of activity is a slowing of tumor progression and inhibition of angiogen- esis both of which are useful in the highly vascularized cancers, RCC and GIST. The median TTP (time to tumor progression) was 27.3 weeks for sunitinib and 6.4 weeks for placebo. Progression-free survival was also significant with a median time of 24.1 weeks for sunitinib and 6 weeks for placebo. The agent is well absorbed upon oral adminis- tration, and both the parent and major metabolite are highly (90%–95%) protein bound. Metabolism is mediated prima- rily by CYP3A4 to give the N-desethyl derivative, which is the major metabolite (23%–37%), equally active with the parent and undergoes further metabolism by CYP3A4. The terminal elimination half-life for the parent and N-desethyl derivative are 40 to 60 hours and 80 to 110 hours, respec- tively. Elimination occurs primarily via the feces. Common adverse effects of sunitinib include fatigue, diarrhea, yel- low skin discoloration, anorexia, nausea, and mucositis. Mild myelosuppression has been reported in patients with GIST including neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocy- topenia, and anemia. There have been reports of cardiotox- icity including decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, which occurred in 11% of patients during a GIST study. MISCELLANEOUS COMPOUNDS TEMSIROLIMUS (CCI-779, TORISEL) Temsirolimus (Fig. 10.27) is an esterified derivative of rap- amycin and in a similar manner binds initially to the pro- tein FKBP-12(FK506-binding protein).159 This complex then acts to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell division. It is somewhat unique in its method of ki- nase inhibition, because it actually binds to an allosteric modulator of the kinase rather than just binding to the ATP-binding site like most other kinase inhibitors. Binding of temsirolimus inhibits the phosphorylating activity of mTOR. As shown in Table 10.3, mTOR regulates the Akt/PKB pathway, and therefore, one way in which the agent acts is to inhibit this pathway. An additional mecha- nism involves the ability of mTOR to initiate protein syn- thesis independent of the Akt/PKB pathway. Blockade of mTOR results in inhibition of protein synthesis and pre- vents the cell from moving past the G1 phase into the S phase. More specifically, mTOR is prevented from phos- phorylating 4E-binding protein-1(4E-BP1) an initiating factor and 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6 kinase), both of which are involved in initiating protein synthesis necessary for the cell cycle. In addition, mTOR is involved in the control of several growth factors such VEGF, PDGF, and TGF, which are involved in cell growth and angiogen- esis. Temsirolimus is available as a 25-mg/mL injection for IV administration in the treatment of advanced RCC. The agent is extensively metabolized and undergoes rapid hy- drolysis of the ester function to give rapamycin that retains activity.160 Additional metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP3A4 to give several hydroxylated and demethylated metabolites that are inactive. The agent and metabolites are eliminated primarily in the feces with half-lives of 17 and 55 hours for temsirolimus and rapamycin, respectively. This agent, like rapamycin, possesses immunosuppressant properties and there is an increased risk of infection. The most serious side effects are interstitial lung disease, perforation of the bowel, and acute renal failure although these occur only rarely.
