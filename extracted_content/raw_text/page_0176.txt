ALKALOIDS� 237 Occurrence of the biosynthetically com- plex ergot alkaloids in both fungi and higher plants is unusual and of consider- able chemotaxonomjc interest. Aside from Claviceps species and the members of the Convolvulaceae, ergot alkaloids have been reported only in a few other fungi—Asper- gillus fumigatus Fres., Penicilliuni cherme- sinu m Biourge, Penicilliu,n roquefortii Thorn, Rhizo pus arrhizus Fischer and Sphacelia ty- phina. Only clavine alkaloids were detected in these latter species. IMIDAZOLE ALKALOIDS The imidazole (glyoxaline) ring is the principal nucleus in pilocarpine from pi -locarpus. Pilocarpine is a monoacidic ter- tiary base containing a lactone group as well as the imidazole nucleus. Obvious structural similarities suggest that this al- kaloid probably is formed from histidine or a metabolic equivalent, but experimental confirmation of such a biosynthetic origin is lacking. Pilocarpus and pilocarpine are the im- portant drugs of this group —� Pilocarpine Pilocarpus or jaborandi Consists of the leaflets of Pi!ocarpus jaborandi Holmes (Per- nambuco jaborandi), of P. microphyllus Stapf (Maranliam jaborandi), or of P. pin- natifolius Lamaire (Paraguay jaborandi) (Fam. Rutaceae). The plants are shrubs in- digenous to Brazil. All of the commercial kinds of piocar- pus, when freshly dried, yield from 0.5 to 1% of the alkaloid piocarpine. Isopilocar- pine, pilocarpidine, and pilosine are also present in some of the species. Even under ideal storage conditions, the leaves lose at least half of their alkaloidal content in 1 year through deterioration. Leaves that are 2 years old are practically worthless. H C,H5� H a PIocarpine Pilocarpine is the lactone of pilocarpic acid, an acid with a glyoxaline nucleus. It is an oily, syrupy liquid, though its salts crystallize easily. It may be obtained by treating the powdered leaves with sodium carbonate, extracting with benzene, and then shaking the benzene extract with di- lute hydrochloric or nitric acid. The aqueous solution is then made alkaline and shaken with chloroform; the chloroform solution is then shaken with acid, and the alkaloidal salt is allowed to crystallize. Pilocarpine directly stimulates the mus- carinic receptors in the eye, causing con- striction of the pupil and contraction of the ciliary muscle In narrow-angle glaucoma, miosis opens the anterior chamber angle to improve the outflow of aqueous humor. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the increase in outflow is independent of the miotic ef- fect. Contraction of the ciliary muscle en- hances the outflow of aqueous humor via indirect effects on the trabecular system. Pilocarpine hydrochloride is the hydro- chloride of an alkaloid obtained from the dried leaflets of Pilocarpus jahornudi or of P micro phyllus. It is hygroscopic. Pilocarpine nitrate is the nitrate of the alkaloid. It is stable in air but is affected by light. Pilocarpine hydrochloride occurs as col- orless, translucent, odorless, faintly bitter crystals; pilocarpine nitrate occurs as shiny, white crystals. USE AND DOSE. Both pilocarpine hydro- chloride and pilocarpine nitrate are cholin- ergic (ophthalmic) drugs used in the treat- ment of glaucoma. They are applied topically, 0.05 to 0.1 nil of a 0.25 to 10% solution of pilocarpine hydrochloride or of a 0.5 to 6% solution of pilocarpine nitrate to the conjunctiva, I to 6 times a day. The patient should be advised to wash hands immediately after application. Pilocarpine
