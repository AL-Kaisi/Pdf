Optical Isomerism and Biological Activity The widespread occurrence of differences in biological ac- tivities for optical activities has been of particular impor- tance in the development of theories on the nature of drug–receptor interactions. Most commercial drugs are asymmetric, meaning that they cannot be divided into symmetrical halves. Although D- and L-isomers have the same physical properties, a large number of drugs are diastereomeric, meaning that they have two or more asym- metric centers. Diastereomers have different physical prop- erties. Examples are the diastereomers ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The former has a melting point of 79° and is soluble in water, whereas pseudoephedrine’s melting point is 118°, and it is only sparingly soluble in water. Keep in mind that receptors will be asymmetric because they are mostly protein, meaning that they are constructed from L- amino acids. A ligand fitting the hypothetical receptor shown in Figure 2.18 will have to have a positively charged moiety in the upper left corner and a hydrophobic region in the upper right. Therefore, one would predict that optical isomers will also have different biological properties. Well- known examples of this phenomenon include (�)- hyoscyamine, which exhibits 15 to 20 times more mydriatic activity than (�)-hyoscyamine, and (�)-ephedrine, which shows three times more pressor activity than (�)-ephedrine, five times more pressor activity than (�)-pseudoephedrine, and 36 times more pressor activity than (�)-pseu- doephedrine. All of ascorbic acid’s antiscorbutic properties reside in the (�) isomer. A postulated fit to epinephrine’s receptor can explain why (�)-epinephrine exhibits 12 to 15 times more vasoconstrictor activity than (�)-epinephrine. This is the classical three-point attachment model. For epi- nephrine, the benzene ring, benzylic hydroxyl, and proto- nated amine must have the stereochemistry seen with the (�) isomer to match up with the hydrophobic or aromatic region, anionic site, and a hydrogen-bonding center on the receptor. The (�) isomer (the mirror image) will not align properly on the receptor. Frequently, the generic name indicates a specific stereoisomer. Examples include levodopa, dextroampheta- mine, dextromethorphan, levamisole, dexmethylphenidate, levobupivacaine, dexlansoprazole, and levothyroxine. Sometimes, the difference in pharmacological activity be- tween stereoisomers is dramatic. The dextrorotatory isomers in the morphine series are cough suppressants with less risk of substance abuse, whereas the levorotatory isomers (Fig. 2.19) contain the analgesic activity and significant risk of substance abuse. Although the direction of optical rotation is opposite to that of the morphine series, dextropropoxyphene contains the analgesic activity, and the levo-isomer contains antitussive activity. More recently drugs originally mar- keted as racemic mixtures are reintroduced using the active isomer. The generic name of the latter does not readily indi- cate that the new product is a specific stereoisomer of a product already in use. Examples include racemic citalo- pram and its S-enantiomer escitalopram; racemic omepra- zole and its S-enantiomer esomeprazole; and racemic modafinil and its R-enantiomer armodafinil. Figure 2.17 contains examples of drugs with asymmetric carbons. Some were originally approved as racemic mix- tures, and later a specific isomer was marketed with claims of having fewer adverse reactions in patients. An example of the latter is the local anesthetic levobupivacaine, which is the S-isomer of bupivacaine. Both the R- and S-isomers have good local anesthetic activity, but the R-isomer may cause depression of the myocardium leading to decreased cardiac output, heart block hypotension, bradycardia, and ventricu- lar arrhythmias. In contrast, the S-isomer shows less cardiotoxic responses but still good local anesthetic activity. Escitalopram is the S-isomer of the antidepressant citalo- pram. There is some evidence that the R-isomer, which contains little of the desired selective serotonin reuptake in- hibition, contributes more to the adverse reactions than does the S-isomer. As dramatic as the previous examples of stereoselectivity may be, sometimes it may not be cost-effective to resolve 30 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry
