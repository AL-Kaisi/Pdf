Nicotine is primarily a product of root metabolism, but the formation of small amounts, as well as subsequent reactions such as the demethylation of nicotine, can occur in the leaves of plants. USE.

Areca Areca, areca nut, or betel nut is the dried, ripe seed of Areca catechu Line (Fam. Palmae). Areca is the Spanish and Portuguese term for the betel nut. Catechu is the East Indian name for an astringent extract or juice. Areca cat echu is a beautiful tall palm extensively cultivated in India, southeastern Asia, the East Indies, and to some extent East Africa. The fruit is a nut that contains a single seed with a thin seed coat and a large ruminate endosperm. The seeds are removed from the fruits, boiled in water containing lime, and dried. India is a major producer of areca, but its pro- duction is mostly consumed domestically. The United States imports the drug from Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka also exports to India when areca is in short supply. Areca is mixed with lime, the leaves of Piper betle Linné, and occasionally gambir.
