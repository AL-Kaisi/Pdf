ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS (ARBs) • Losartan, many others Block AT1 angiotensin receptors Same as ACE inhibitors but no increase in bradykinin Hypertension • heart failure Oral • Toxicity: Same as ACE inhibitors but less cough and angioedema RENIN INHIBITOR • Aliskiren Inhibits enzyme activity of renin Reduces angiotensin I and II and aldosterone Hypertension Oral • Toxicity: Hyperkalemia, renal impairment • potential teratogen SYMPATHOPLEGICS, CENTRALLY ACTING • Clonidine, methyldopa Activate α2 adrenoceptors Reduce central sympathetic outflow • reduce norepinephrine release from noradrenergic nerve endings Hypertension • clonidine also used in withdrawal from abused drugs Oral • clonidine also as patch • Toxicity: sedation • methyldopa hemolytic anemia— withdrawal syndrome with sudden discontinuation of high­dose clonidine treatment SYMPATHETIC NERVE TERMINAL BLOCKERS • Reserpine Blocks vesicular amine transporter in noradrenergic nerves and depletes transmitter stores Reduces all sympathetic effects, especially cardiovascular, and reduce blood pressure Hypertension but rarely used Oral • long duration (days) • Toxicity: Psychiatric depression, gastrointestinal disturbances • Guanethidine, guanadrel Interferes with amine release and replaces norepinephrine in vesicles Same as reserpine Same as reserpine Severe orthostatic hypotension • sexual dysfunction • availability limited α BLOCKERS • Prazosin • Terazosin • Doxazosin Selectively block α1 adrenoceptors Prevent sympathetic vasoconstriction • reduce prostatic smooth muscle tone Hypertension • benign prostatic hyperplasia Oral • Toxicity: Orthostatic hypotension β BLOCKERS • Metoprolol, others • Carvedilol • Nebivolol Block β1 receptors; carvedilol also blocks α receptors; nebivolol also releases nitric oxide Prevent sympathetic cardiac stimulation • reduce renin secretion Hypertension • heart failure • coronary disease See Chapter 10 • Propranolol: Nonselective prototype β blocker • Metoprolol and atenolol: Very widely used β1­selective blockers VASODILATORS
