COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN: NEWER METHODS Because powerful computing power, high-resolution com- puter graphics, and applicable software has reached the desktop, computational drug design methods are widely used in both industrial and academic environments. Through the use of computer graphics, structures of or- ganic molecules can be entered into a computer and manip- ulated in many ways. Computational chemistry methods are used to calculate molecular properties and generate pharmacophore hypotheses. Once a pharmacophore hy- pothesis has been developed, structural databases (com- mercial, corporate, and/or public) of 3D structures can be searched rapidly for hits (i.e., existing compounds that are available with the required functional groups and permissi- ble spatial orientations as defined by the search query). It has become popular to carry out in silico (computer as op- posed to biological) screening of drug–receptor candidate interactions, known as virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS), for future development. The realistic goal of vHTS is to identify potential lead compounds. The drug–receptor fit and predicted physicochemical properties are used to score and rank compounds according to penalty functions and information filters (molecular weight, number of hy- drogen bonds, hydrophobicity, etc.). Although medicinal chemists have always been aware of absorption, distribu- tion, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity (ADMET or ADME/Tox), in recent years, a much more focused ap- proach addresses these issues in the early design stages. Increased efforts to develop computer-based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) models are being pursued aggressively. Many of the predictive ADME models use QSAR methods described earlier in this chapter. In general, understanding what chemical space descriptors are critical for druglike molecules helps provide insight into the design of chemical libraries for biological evaluation. Today’s computers and software give the medicinal chemist the ability to design the molecule on the basis of an estimated fit onto a receptor or have similar spatial charac- teristics found in the prototypical lead compound. Of course, this assumes that the molecular structure of the re- ceptor is known in enough detail for a reasonable estimation of its 3D shape. When a good understanding of the geome- try of the active site is known, databases containing the 3D coordinates of the chemicals in the database can be searched rapidly by computer programs that select candidates likely to fit in the active site. As shown later, there have been some dramatic successes with use of this approach, but first one must have an understanding of ligand (drug)–receptor inter- actions and conformational analysis. Forces Involved with Drug–Receptor Interactions Keep in mind that a biological response is produced by the interaction of a drug with a functional or organized group of molecules. This interaction would be expected to take place by using the same bonding forces as are involved when sim- ple molecules interact. These, together with typical exam- ples, are collected in Table 2.9. Most drugs do not possess functional groups of a type that would lead to ready formation of strong and essentially irreversible covalent bonds between drug and biological re- ceptors. In most cases, it is desirable to have the drug leave the receptor site when the concentration decreases in the ex- tracellular fluids. Therefore, most useful drugs are held to their receptors by ionic or weaker bonds. When relatively long-lasting or irreversible effects are desired (e.g., antibac- terial, anticancer), drugs that form covalent bonds with the receptor are effective and useful. The alkylating agents, such as the nitrogen mustards used in cancer chemotherapy, furnish an example of drugs that act by formation of cova- lent bonds (see Chapter 10). Covalent bond formation between drug and receptor is the basis of Baker’s concept of active-site-directed irre- versible inhibition.17 Considerable experimental evidence on the nature of enzyme inhibitors supports this concept. Compounds studied possess appropriate structural features for reversible and highly selective association with an en- zyme. If, in addition, the compounds carry reactive groups capable of forming covalent bonds, the substrate may be ir- reversibly bound to the drug–receptor complex by covalent bond formation with reactive groups adjacent to the active site. The diuretic drug ethacrynic acid (see Chapter 19) is an �,�-unsaturated ketone, thought to act by covalent bond formation with sulfhydryl groups of ion transport systems in the renal tubules. Another example of a drug that cova- lently binds to the receptor is selegiline (see Chapter 13), an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B. Other examples of co- valent bond formation between drug and biological recep- tor site include the reaction of arsenicals and mercurials with cysteine sulfhydryl groups, the acylation of bacterial cell wall constituents by penicillin, and the phosphorylation Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 25 TABLE 2.9 Types of Chemical Bonds Bond Strength Bond Type (kcal/mol) Example Covalent 40–140 Reinforced ionic 10 Ionic 5 Hydrogen 1–7 Ion–dipole 1–7 Dipole–dipole 1–7 van der Waals 0.5–1 Hydrophobic 1 See text Source: Albert, A.: Selective Toxicity.
