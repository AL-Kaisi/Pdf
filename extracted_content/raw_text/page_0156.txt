ALKALOIDS� 217 The diluents may he colored with caramel to simulate the color of the drug. Powdered opium is used in making Do- ver's powder and camphorated opium tincture and is combined with other agents in antidiarrheal preparations. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Diabismul®, KBP/O®. Paregoric or camphorated opium tinc- ture is classed as an antiperistaltic. The usual dose of paregoric is 5 to 10 ml, Ito 4 times a day, and it may be mixed before taking with a small amount of water to form a milky solution. It is used in com- bination with belladonna alkaloids, kaolin, pectin, and/or other ingredients for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Many of these preparations are Schedule V drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. NONPRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Parepec- bun®, Parelixir®, DonnagelPG®. Laudanum, opium tincture, or deodor- ized opium tincture was formerly used similarly to paregoric. Its dose is 0.6 ml, 4 times a day. Poppy seed or maw seed is the dried seed of Papaver srnnniferuin variety nigrum DeCandolle. The seeds are bluish black or yellowish white, reniform, from 0.5 to I mm in diameter, and reticulate. They have a yellowish hilum scar, a white oily en- dosperm, and a curved embryo. Their taste is slight and oily. Poppy seeds are used in baking (poppy seed rolls). They contain about 50% of a fixed oil (poppy seed oil), which is used in some parenteral formu- lations, by artists as a drying oil, and also for food and salad dressings. Poppy seed oil cake is used as a cattle food. Poppy seed contains no significant quantity of alka- loids. Alkaloids of Opium Morphine is the most important of the opium alkaloids. Morphine and the related alkaloids are phenanthrene derivatives. The molecule contains a phenolic and an alcoholic hydroxyl group. The alkaloid and its salts Occur as white silky crystals, sometimes in cubic masses, or as a fine crystalline powder. It is stable in air, odorless, and bitter-tasting. Morphine Morphine and its salts are classed as nar- cotic analgesics; they are strongly hypnotic and narcotic. Their use tends to induce nausea, vomiting, constipation, and habit formation. The usual dose of morphine sul- fate, parenterally, is 10 mg, 6 times a day, as necessary. Centrally acting analgesics, in most cases, have certain structural features in common. They are: (1) a central carbon atom with no hydrogen substitution (qua- ternary), (2) a phenyl group or isostere at- tached to this carbon atom, (3) a tertiary nitrogen atom, and (4) a 2-carbon bridge separating the tertiar y nitrogen atom and the central carbon atom. Morphine and the related opium alka- loids that have analgesic activity possess these structural features. In the case of morphine, the central carbon atom is C-13; the phenyl ring attached to C-13 is com- posed of carbon atoms I to 4 and 11. and 12; and the tertiary nitrogen atom is linked via a 2-carbon bridge (C-15, C-16) to the central carbon atom. Codeine is the most widely used opium alkaloid. It may be either obtained from opium (0.2 to 0.7%) or prepared from mor- phine by methylation or from thebaine by appropriate reduction and demethylation. Codeine is methylmorphine in which the methyl group replaces the hydrogen of the phenolic hydroxyl group. Codeine and its salts occur as fine needles or as white crys- talline powders that effloresce in air.
