In essence, some or all of the drug may be metabolized by the liver. Consequently, its bioavailability is decreased. Thus, the bioavailable fraction is determined by the fraction of drug that is absorbed from the gastro­ intestinal tract and the fraction that escapes metabolism during its first pass through the liver. The bioavailable fraction (f) is the product of these two fractions as follows: f = fraction of drug absorbed x fraction escaping first-pass metabolism The bioavailability is lowest, then, for drugs that undergo a significant first-pass effect. For these drugs, a hepatic extraction ratio, or the fraction of drug metabolized, E, is cal­ culated. The fraction of drug that enters the systemic circula­ tion and is ultimately available to exert its effect then is equal to the quantity (1 - E). Table 5.7 lists some drugs according to their pharmacologic class that undergo a significant first­ pass effect when administered by the oral route. To compensate for this marked effect, the manufacturer may consider other routes of administration, for example, TABLE 5.7. Some Drugs That Undergo Significant Liver Metabolism and Exhibit Low Bioavailability When Administered By First-Pass Routes Drug Class Analgesic Antianginal Antiarrhythmic Beta-adrenergic blocker Calcium channel blocker Sympathomimetic amine Tricyclic antidepressant Examples Aspirin, meperidine, pentazocine, propoxyphene Nitroglycerin Lidocaine Labetalol, metoprolol, propranolol Verapamil lsoproterenol Desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline intravenous, intramuscular, or sublingual, that avoid the first-pass effect. Use of these routes must be accompanied by a corresponding adjustment in the dosage. Another consideration centers on the metabolites them - selves and whether they are pharmacologically active or inactive. If they are inactive, a larger oral dose is required to attain the desired therapeutic effect than with a lower dosage in a route with no first-pass effect. The classic example of drug that exhibits this effect is propranolol. However, if the metab­ olites are the active species, the oral dosage must be carefully tailored to the desired therapeutic effect. First-pass metabo­ lism in this case will result in a quicker therapeutic response than that achieved by a route with no first-pass effect. Also, the flow of blood through the liver can be decreased under certain conditions. Consequently, the bioavailability of drugs that undergo a first-pass effect can be expected to increase. For example, during cirrhosis, the blood flow to the kidney is dramatically decreased, and efficient hepatic extraction by enzymes responsible for a drug's metabo­ lism also falls off. Consequently, in cirrhotic patients, the dosage of drug that undergoes a first-pass effect from oral administration will have to be reduced to avoid toxicity. Oral Route Drugs are most frequently taken by oral administration. Although a few drugs taken orally are intended to be dissolved in the mouth, nearly all drugs taken orally are swallowed.
