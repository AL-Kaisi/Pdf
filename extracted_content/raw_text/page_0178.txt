Veratrum viride contains a large number of alkaloids customarily classified in 3 groups on the basis of their chemical con- stitution. Group I, consisting of esters of the steroidal bases (alkarnines) with or- ganic acids, includes cevadine, gerrnidine, germitrine, neogermitrine, neoprotovera- trine, protoveratririe, and veratridine. Group II includes pseudojervine and ver- atrosine, which are glucosides of the alkamjnes. The alkamines themselves- germirie, jervine, rubijervine, and vera- tramine—compose group III. The ester al- kaloids, germidine and germitrirte, are probably the most important therapeuti- cally. The complexity and relative instabil- ity of these constituents account for the problems encountered in the biologic standardization of this drug. USES. Veratrum viride possesses hypo- tensive, cardiac-depressant, and sedative properties. It has been used in the treat- ment of hypertension. Small doses prin- cipally affect blood pressure without no- tably changing respiratory or cardiac rate. The drug has its most uniform effects in small doses. Veratrum viride, in the form of the tinc- ture, was used for many years by American physicians as a cardiac depressant. This form of medication was abandoned when a study of the alkaloids demonstrated their hypotensive properties. White hellebore or European hellebore is the dried rhizome of Veratrun album. Linné (Fain. Lilaceae). It is similar to V. viride but is indigenous to central and southern Europe. White hellebore is simi- lar in appearance and structure to green hellebore, but the external color is much lighter. The drug contains a complex mixture of ester alkaloids, glycoalkaloids, and alka- mines similar, and in some cases identical, to those occurring in veratrum viride. Two ester alkaloids, protoveratrine A and pro- toveratrine B, are the most active. On hy- drolysis, both yield protoverine, acetic acid, methyihutyric acid, and methylhy- droxybutyric acid (in protoveratrine A) or methyldihydroxybutyric acid (in proto- veratrine B). USES. White hellebore possesses hypo- tensive properties, but the crude drug is not used therapeutically. Both white and green hellebores are also employed as in- secticides. ALKALOIDAL AMINES The alkaloids in this group do not con- tain heterocyclic nitrogen atoms. Many are simple derivatives of phenylethvlamine and, as such, are derived from the common amino acids, phenylalaninc or tyrosine. Some of the alkaloids in this category whose biosynthesis has been studied uti- lizing labeled precursors include hor- denine in barley (1-lordeum vulgare), mes- caline in the peyote cactus (Lophophorn williamsii), ephedrine in Ephedra distachyn, Prototeratrine A
