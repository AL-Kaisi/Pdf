ALKALOIDS� 219 resented by the products Hycodanx and Tussend5. Noscapine (commonly called narcotine) exists in opium as a free base (1.3 to 1017o). It possesses no narcotic properties and is therefore sometimes called anarcotine. To eliminate misunderstanding and wrong connotation, the name noscapine is em- ployed in pharmaceutic literature, but nar- cotine remains the common chemical des- ignation of this alkaloid. Noscapine is an antitussive. The usual dose is 15 mg, up to 4 times a day. It is available in syrup and chewable tablets in the nonprescription preparations Conar5 and Actol®. A long-standing prescription product composed of the hydrochlorides of the al- kaloids of opium in the same proportion in which they occur in the natural product is Pantopon® . This drug has been freed from inert or irritating gums, waxes, and resins, and it may be administered parenterally, either subcutaneously or intramuscularly, in a dose of 5 to 20 mg every 4 to 5 hours. The term "opioid" has been devised to refer to the synthetic morphinelike com- pounds. Many of these substances offer the same narcotic and pain-relieving prop- erties as morphine, but they are not as habit-forming. Others possess the cough- relieving activity of codeine but are not addictive. INDOLE ALKALOIDS A number of important alkaloids possess an indole ring as part of their structure. Strychnine and brucine (dime thoxystrych- nine) from nux vomica and physostigmine from physostigma belong to this group. However, strychnine and brucine also con- tain a quinoline nucleus, and some authors classify them in the quinoline group. The important drugs and their alkaloids of the indole group are rauwolfia, reseT- pine, catharanthus (ymca), vinblastine, vincnstine, flux vomica, strychnine, bru- one, physostigma, phYsostigmine, ergot, ergotamine, and ergonovine. Biosynthesis of Indole Alkaloids Many of the therapeutically useful in- dole alkaloids are rather complex multi- cyclic molecules. Incorporation of a tryp- tamirie moiety into this type of alkaloid was established at a fairly early stage in the study of alkaloid biosynthesis. The origin of the balance of the molecules proved more elusive. However, it is now estab- lished that the nontryptophan portions of the molecules are derived from monoter- penoid precursors. Three general mono- terpenoid skeletons give rise to most of the complex indole alkaloids; these skeletons are designated as the Aspidosperma, Cory- nanthe, and ihoga types, taking the names of genera that are rich in alkaloids with the respective monoterpenoici nuclei (Fig. 8-15). The reactive form of the terpene presum- ably involves an aldehyde group, and the loss of one carbon atom during the biosyn- thetic process to give a C0 unit appears to be fairly common. Most of the details on the sequence of biosynthetic reactions and various rearrangements remain to be clar- ified. It is suspected that the Curynanthe type of rnonoterpenoid moiety is metabol- ically the most primitive. Studies on the formation of therapeutically unimportant monomeric alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus have demonstrated that the glucoside, se- coluganin, provides the terpenoid unit. Evidence suggests that secologanin reacts initially with tryptarrthte to form strictosi- dine (see Fig. 8-10) and that the glycosidic linkage is cleaved during subsequent met- abolic steps. The Rauvulfia alkaloids, ajrnaline, reser- pine, and serpentine, are derived from a Con,'nanthe-type monoterpenoid precursor. They can be used to illustrate some of the multicyclic structures that arise during ter- tiary cyclization and rearrangement steps in biosynthesis (Fig. 8-16) Ergot Alkaloids. The alkaloids of ergot are
