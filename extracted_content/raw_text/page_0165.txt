During the course of a modern scientific investigation prompted by the folklore rep- utation of this plant as an oral hypogly- cemic agent, the ability of certain fractions to produce peripheral granulocytopenia and bone marrow depression in rats was observed by the Canadian group of Noble, Beer, and Cutts. Continued study led to the isolation of an alkaloid, vinbiastine, which produced severe leukopenia in rats. Recognizing the anticancer potential of this plant, G. H. Svoboda and coworkers at Eli Lilly and Company isolated an ex- tremely large number of alkaloids from the plant. Of these, 4 dimeric indole-indoline compounds, vinblastjne, vinleurosine, vinrosidine and vincristine, possess de- monstrable oncolytic activity. An extremely confusing situation regarding the nomen- clature of these alkaloids exists in the sci- entific literature. The names just men- tioned are the United States Adopted Drug Names but are not the names assigned by the original discoverers who, by tradition, are accorded the privilege of selecting the scientific name for a new chemical corn- pound of complex structure. Equivalent names of these alkaloids are: U.S. Adopted�Scientific Drug Names� Names Vinbiastine = Vincaleukoblastine (VLB) Vinleurosine Leurosine Vinrosidine = Leurosidinc Vincristine = Leurocristine (LC) Because the active alkaloids exist in the crude drug in relatively small amounts, enormous quantities of the latter are re- quired for commercial production. Nearly 500 kg of catharanthus are utilized to pro- duce 1 g of vincristine. To satisfy the de- mand, the plant is collected from both nat-
