Peyote or mescal buttons consist of the dried tops of Lophophori welliamsii (Le- maire) Coulter (Fam. Cactaceae), growing in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States (Fig. 8-27). The main axis of the plant lies beneath the ground, and from it arise a number of aerial shoots that are button-shaped or disklike and reach . 0 to 50 mm in diameter. In the center of each disk are a tuft of hairs and usually one or more pink flowers. This plant has been associated with In- dian ceremonies for many years. It disturbs normal mental function and causes con- comitant hallucinations and euphoria. Ingestion of mescal buttons results in my- driasis accompanied by unusual and bi- zarre color perception. Flashing lights and vivid configurations characterize the vi- sions at first; later, the colors become dim and the subjects become drowsy; eventu- ally, sleep is produced. The drug contains several alkaloids, in- duding mescaline (the most active of the peyote constituents), anhalanine, anhal- amine, and anhalidine. Mescaline (3,4,5,- trimethoxy-13-phenylethylarnine) also oc- curs in other cacti, e.g., Trichocereus species, or it may be produced syntheti- cally. CH3O( NH 7 OCH Mescaline Mescaline is regarded as the first of a series of hallucinogens or psvchotomimet- ics. Others are psilocybin (obtained from the mushroom Psilonjbe mexicilua Heim) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). All of these drugs have proved valuable in ex- perimental psychiatry. PURINE BASES The puriries are derivatives of a hetero- cyclic nucleus consisting of the 6-mem- bered pyrimidine ring fused to the 5-mem- bered imidazole ring. Purine itself does not occur in nature, but numerous derivatives are biologically significant. The pharma- ceutically important bases of this group are all methylated derivatives of 2,6-dioxypu- rine (xanthine). Caffeine is 1,3,7-trimeth- ylxanthine, theophylline is 1,3-dimeth- ylxanthine, and theobromine is 3,7-dimethyixanthine (see page 247). The methyixanthines competitively in- hibit phosphodiesterase, which results in an increase of cyclic adenosine monophos- phate with a subsequent release of endog- enous epinephrine. This results in a direct relaxation of the smooth muscles of the bronchi and pulmonary blood vessels, a stimulation of the central nervous system, an induction of diuresis, an increase in gas- tric acid secretion, an inhibition of uterine
