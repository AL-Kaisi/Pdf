Important nitrogen-containing ring structures present in alkaloidal drugs. sible function of alkaloids in plants and about the reaons why they occur there. Some of the possibilities that have been discussed include their functions as (t-poi- sonous agents protecting the plant against insects and herbivores, products of detoxification reactions representing a met- abolic locking-up of compounds otherwise harmful to the plan 'regulatory growth factors, or £4serve substances capable of supplying nitrogen or other elements necessary to the plant's economy. Although certain exceptions exist be- cause of the diverse nature of alkaloids, the evidence for any result of alkaloid forma- tion useful to the existence of the plant is slight. Perhaps the best example of such a result is found in the wild plants of certain and regions, where overgrazing by do- mestic animals has taken place for centu- ries.. An extremely high percentage of such plants contains alkaloids that, because of their bitter taste or toxic properties, appar- ently confer survival value on the species producing them. Plants lacking such dis- tasteful substances were long ago exter- minated. However, to avoid being teleo- logic, we must emphasize that protection, like the other postulated functions, is a consequence of, not a reason for, alkaloid formation. Perhaps alkaloids should be viewed as products of metabolic experimentation that reflect the intermediary evolutionary stages now attained by plants. Alkaloid formation is probably best regarded as a metabolic act involving longer or shorter reaction sequences that begin with sub- stances normal and essential in plant me- tabolism and end with compounds not nec- essarily serving such a purpose. Because the process is genetically controlled, an al- kaloid-producing plant is merely a plant in which this additional metabolic reaction has evolved through mutation of one or more genes. Proof that such changes occur irrespective of the utility of ultimate prod- ucts is given by the thousands of pigments, tannins, polysaccharides, glycosides, vol- atile oils, and resins to which no essential role in plant metabolism can be ascribed. Like many of these other secondary con- stituents, the alkaloids may be thought of as resulting from a ''metabolic error," which will probably be eliminated when plants approach a stage of ultimate adap- tation and eliminate all redundant features and processes. They are thus a kind of waste product retained within the orga- nism that produces them. It must be em- phasized that, unlike many such sub- stances with which we are familiar, the alkaloids are structurally complex end products of energy-requiring reaction se- quences. The pharmacologic action of alkaloids varies widely: some (morphine, codeine) are analgesics and narcotics whereas oth- ers (strychnine, brucine) are central stim- ulants. Some (atropine) are mydriatics whereas others (physostigmine, pilocar- pine) are miotics. Some (ephedrine) cause
