240ï¿½ ALKALOIDS cathinone in the khat plant (Catha edulis), and coichicine in the autumn crocus (Cot- chicuni autuninn1). Ring A and carbon atoms 5, 6, and 7 of coichicine derive from the phenylalanine- cirinamic acid pathway in Colchicum species (Fig. 8-25). Tyrosine cannot replace phen- ylalanine as a precursor for this part of the molecule. Radioactivity from tyrosine314C is incorporated into the C-12 position of the tropolone ring. Many of the details of the biosynthetic pathway are unknown; a phenethylisoquinoline intermediate is sus- pected, and androcynihine also occurs in Colchicurn. Labeled acetate is readily incor- porated into the acetyl group of the mole- cule, presumably during a terminal phase of biosynthesis. Other alkaloidal amines are tryptarnine derivatives and, as such, are biosynthe- sized from tryptophan. Examples include gramine in Hordeum oulgare, psilocybin in the Mexican hallucinogenic mushroom, Psilocijhe se?nperviva, and serotonin and bu- fotenine in a number of plant and animal species The drugs and their alkaloids classified as alkaloidal amines are ephedra, ephed- rine, colchicum seed, colchicum corm, col- chicine, khat, and peyote. Ephedrine Ephedra or ma huang is the entire plant or the overground portion of Ephedra sinica Stapf (Earn. Gnetaceae). In Chinese char- acters, "ma" means astringent and "huang" means yellow, probably referring to the taste and color of the drug. It has been used as a medicine in China for more than 5000 years. Its use in modern medi- cine began in 1923 with the discovery of the valuable properties of ephedrine. The plant is found near the seacoast in southern China, and this source formerly supplied most of the American market. At the pres- ent time, northwestern India and Pakistan represent the areas from which ephedra is obtained. The plant is a low, dioccious, practically lealfless shrub that grows 60 to 90 cm high. The stem is green, slender, erect, small ribbed and channeled. It is 1.5 mm in di- ameter and usually terminates in a sharp point. At the nodes, which are 4 to 6 cm apart, the leaves appear as whitish, trian- gular, scarious sheaths. Small blossoms ap- pear in the summer. Ephedrine or - )-erytJiro--L1-(methyl- amino)ethyl]beitzyl alcohol is an alkaloid produced commercially either by the ex- traction of plant material (Ephedra spp.) or by a chemical procedure involving a re- ductive condensation between L-1-phenyl- 1-acety!carhinol and methylamine (Fig. 8-26). This yields 1-ephedrine essentially free from the D-isomer. The carbinol pre- cursor used in the reaction is produced hio- synthetically bv the fermentative action of brewer's eest on henzaldehyde. Studies indicate that the reaction in- volves the dismutation of pyruvic acid to lactic acid and acetyl-CoA which, in turn, condenses with benzaldehyde to yield L-1- phenyl-1-acetylcarbinol. An undesirable by-product of the fer- mentation process is benzyl alcohol, which is produced as a result of competition for the benza!dchyde by the carbinol synthe- sizing s ystem and another enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase. Addition of structural an- alogs of nicotinamide to the fermentation medium appreciably reduces benzyl alco- hol production. These probably function by competing with NAD for its enzyme site because NADH 2 is required as the H donor in the reductive reaction. Ephedrine occurs as white, rosette or needle crystals, or as an unctuous mass. it is soluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, ether, and in liquid petrolatum. The latter solution is turbid if the ephedrine is not dry. Ephedrine melts between 33 and 40 C, depending on its water content. USES AND DOSE. Ephedrine is a potent sympathomimetic that stimulates alpha, beta,, and beta, adrenergic receptors. It ex- cites the sympathetic nervous system, causes vasoconstriction and cardiac stim-
