228� ALKALOIDS derivative of vinbiastine, was released in 1984 for use in patients who have become resistant to vincristine and viriblastine. Nux Vomica Nux vomica is the dried, ripe seed of Strvchnos nux-voinica Linné (Fam. Logani- aceae). Strychnos is the Greek name for a number of poisonous plants; nux-vwnica is from 2 Latin words and means a nut that causes vomiting. The plant is a small tree, about 12 meters tall, that is native to the East Indies and is also found in the forests of Sri Lanka, on the Malabar Coast, and in northern Aus- tralia. The fruit is a berry with from 3 to 5 seeds (Fig. 8-20) that are freed from the bitter pulp by washing before exportation. Most of the commercial supply comes from Cambodia and Sri Lanka. The drug was introduced into Europe about the 16th cen- tury, although it was used mainl y for poi- soning animals. Its use in medicine began about 1640. The natives of India apparently had no knowledge of its medicinal value. Nux vomica contains alkaloids, 1.5 to 5%, consisting chiefly of strychnine and brucine, the former comprising from one third to one half of the total amount. Stud- ies have shown that these alkaloids occur in the large, thick-wailed cells of the en- dosperm, but strychnine is concentrated in the cells near the center of the seed and brucine in the outer cells near the epider- mis. USE. Nux vomica and the seeds of the closely related Strychnos ignatli Bergius (ig- natia or St. Ignatius bean) serve as a com- mercial source of strychnine and brucine. The former alkaloid is commonly marketed as strychnine sulfate or strychnine phos- phate. Strychnine and brucine (dimethoxy- strychnine) are obtained from nux vomica or ignatia by extraction with dilute sulfuric acid. The solution is concentrated. The al- kaloids are precipitated with lime, sepa- rated by means of solvent, and purified by recrystallization. Brucine is far more solu- ble in water and in alcohol than is strych- nine; however, strychnine sulfate is some- what more soluble in these 2 solvents than is brucirie sulfate. Strychnine is interesting pharmacologi- callyand is a valuable tool in physiologic and neuroanatomic research. It is ex- tremely toxic, functioning as a central stim- ulant. The alkaloid produces excitation of all parts of the central nervous system and blocks inhibitory spinal impulses at the postsynaptic level. This leads to an exag- geration in reflexes, with resulting tonic convulsions. Fatal poisoning in human beings ordinarily results from doses of 60 to 90 mg. The drug is seldom employed in modern medical practice but is utilized as a vermin killer. Brucine, which is less toxic than strychnine, is used commercially as an alcohol denaturant. H '-' strychnine Physostigmine Physostigma, Calabar bean, or ordeal bean is the dried, ripe seed of Physostigmn uenenosum Balfour (Fam. Leguminosae) yielding not less than 0.15% of the alka- loids of physostigma. The name Physostigma is Greek and means an inflated or bladderlike stigma (Fig. 8-21); r'enenosum is Latin and means full of poison. The plant is a perennial, woody climber that grows on the banks of streams in West Africa, particularly in the vicinity of the Gulf of Guinea. In 1846, Daniell described the use of the seed, known as esere by the natives of old Cala- bar, to prove the innocence or guilt of per- Sons accused of crime. Calabar bean contains several alkaloids, physostigmine (eserine), eseramine,
