C HAPTE R 20 Novel Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Technologies 569 APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS GROUP ACTIVITIES 1. In groups of three, create a brief patient handout describing the appropriate use and varying adminis­ tration techniques for Lamictal chewable dispersible tablets. Be specific in your recommendations and suggestions. 2. Select two ophthalmic and one oral inhalation prod­ ucts. In groups of three, one student serves as the pharmacist, the second the patient, and the third the observer. The pharmacist-student role-player will counsel (and demonstrate) the patient on the specific product. After the session, the observer and patient provide constructive feedback on the session. The roles then are rotated utilizing a different product until each of the three students has participated in each of the three roles. 3. To realize the need for novel dosage forms of vaginal administration, access http:/ /www.livestrong.com/ video/1945-menopause-health-byte/. View the men­ strual cycle health video (1: 18 minutes) and the menopause health video (2:09 minutes). Brainstorm possible delivery systems that might be used for intra­ vaginal administration. 4. Interview a classmate who acknowledges using an oral inhalation product, for example, Advair Diskus. Discuss with him or her his or her ability to use the product appropriately, the product's effectiveness, REFERENCES 1. Dutet J, Delgado-Charm M.

In groups of two (one student serves as the pharma­ cist, the second the patient), have the pharmacist explain to the patient the reason for dispensing a pilocarpine (Ocusert) versus his/her traditional pilo­ carpine eye drop solution. This is intended to be an interactive exercise; the patient is expected to ask a series of pertinent follow-up questions. INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES 1. Conduct a literature search to discover five different drugs that utilize liposomal injection technology. 2. Create a pharmacokinetic figure that demonstrates general pharmacokinetic properties (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of the Striant mucoadhesive testosterone buccal system against an orally administered testosterone medication. 3. Provide examples of drugs administered parenterally for a long-acting effect utilizing techniques shared in this chapter, for example, slowly dissolving chemical complexes of the drug entity, solutions or suspen­ sions of drugs in slowly absorbed carriers or vehicles, and large drug particles in suspension. 4. Compare and contrast the administration techniques utilized for the EpiPen, Humulin N Pen, Byetta Pen, and a Glucagon Emergency Rescue Kit. 15. Product Information. http://www.Ontak.com.
