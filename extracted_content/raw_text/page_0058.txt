The iminium ion is likely formed at N-5 because it is the more basic of the two nitrogens, whereas N-10 is the better leaving group. The loss of the proton at the 5-position of dUMP and elimination of folate yields the exocyclic meth- ylene uracil species. The final step involves hydride transfer from THF and elimination to yield the enzyme, DHF, and dTMP. 5-Fluorouracil is activated by conversion to the corre- sponding nucleotide species,53 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridylic acid (see Scheme 10.18). The resulting 5-fluoro-2�-de- oxyuridylic acid is a powerful inhibitor of thymidylate syn- thetase, the enzyme that converts 2�-deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. In the inhibiting reaction, the sulfhydryl group of TS adds via conjugate addition to the 6-position of the fluorouracil moiety (Scheme 10.19). The carbon at the 5-position then binds to the methylene group of 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate following initial formation of the more electrophilic form of folate the N-5-iminium ion. In the normal process, this step is followed by the elimination of dihydrofolate from the ternary complex, regeneration of the active enzyme species, and the product thymidine. Central to this process is the loss of the proton at the 5- position of uracil to form the exocyclic methylene uracil species. The 5-fluorine is stable to elimination, and a termi- nal product results, involving the enzyme, cofactor, and sub- strate, all covalently bonded (Scheme 10.19). The chemical mechanism of inhibition of thymidylate synthetase by 5-fluorouracil is shown in Scheme 10.19. This process clearly shows that in order to inactivate the TS en- zyme, both 5-FU and the tetrahydrofolate species are re- quired to form the ternary complex. Some clinical studies have shown that administration of a tetrahydrofolate source prior to treatment with 5-FU results in greater inhibition of total TS activity. The administered source of active 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate is leucovorin, N-5-formyl- tetrahydrofolate. TS is the most obvious and well-documented mechanism of action for 5-FU cytotoxic activity. However, other mech- anisms may play a role in the overall value of this drug in the treatment of human cancer.
