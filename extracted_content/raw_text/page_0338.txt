They are formulated from insoluble synthetic gum bases, such as polyisoprene, polyisobu­ tylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer, styrene butadi­ ene rubber, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene, ester gus, or polyterpenes. Softening agents, or plasticizers such as propylene glycol, glycerin, oleic acid, or vegetable oils, are added to maintain pliability and aid in the incorporation of the active and inactive ingredients, including sweeteners and flavoring agents. Sugars and artificial sweeteners and fla­ vorings are added to improve taste. Some medicated gums are coated with magnesium stearate to reduce tackiness and improve handling during packaging; sometimes a preservative may be added. Preparation by melting includes melting the gum base to about 115°C until it achieves the viscosity of a thick syrup, at which point it is filtered through a fine-mesh screen. Then sweeteners, plasticizers, and active drugs are added with mixing. Colorings, flavorings, and preserva­ tives are added and mixed while the melted gum is cool­ ing. It is then shaped by extrusion or rolling and cutting. Any additional coating is applied to improve taste and aid in bulk packaging. Preparation by direct compression involves using the gum base in a free-flowing granular powder. It is dry blended with sweeteners, flavors, the active drug, and a lubricant. It is then processed using a conventional tab­ let press into the desired shape and size. The tablets can be further coated with sugar or sugar-free excipients and packaged in blister or bottles as desired. Osmotic Pump Numerous drug delivery devices now use osmosis as the driv­ ing force. As shown in Figure 20.4, the Alzet (Alza osmotic 1,200 Negative 300 Negative 600 Negative 12 or 24 Negative 24 Negative 60 or 300 Negative 300 or 600 Positive 300 Positive 300 Negative 120 Positive minipump) is used in research laboratories to provide con­ stant-rate delivery and programmed delivery of a drug. It consists of a flexible impermeable diaphragm surrounded by a sealed layer containing an osmotic agent that is enclosed within a semipermeable membrane. A stainless steel or polyethylene tube or catheter is inserted into the inner chamber from which the drug is channeled. When the unit is subjected to an aqueous medium, the water flows through the rate-controlling semipermeable membrane and dissolves the osmotic agent that provides the pressure on the flexible lining and forces the drug through the tube or catheter. The unit can be presterilized and prefilled using a filling tube. With the Alzet pump, the drug reservoir is a liquid solution inside an impermeable collapsible polyester bag coated with a layer of an osmotically active salt. It is sealed within a rigid structure coated with a semi­ permeable membrane. As the salt dissolves, it creates an osmotic pressure gradient, and the drug compart­ ment is reduced in volume, forcing the drug solution out. The delivery rate can be changed by changing the drug concentration (3). Drug .,.._ __ Flexible diaphragm �--- Osmotic agent FIGURE :Z0.4. Example mechanism of an osmotic pump.
