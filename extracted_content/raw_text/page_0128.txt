ALKALOIDS� 189 a rise in blood pressure, but others (reser- pine) produce a fall in excessive hyperten- sion. In fact, the alkaloids are capable of extensive physiologic activity. Various schemes for the classification of alkaloids have been suggested. The follow- ing plan is based on the ring structure or nucleus of the chief alkaloid group in the plant drug: (1) pyridine-piperidine com- bined, (2) tropane, (3) quinoline, (4) iso- quinohne, (5) indole, (6) irnidazole, (7) ste- roid, (8) alkaloidal amine, and (9) purine. The biosynthesis of many alkaloidal structures can be rationalized through sim- ple chemical reactions that involve amino acids. The amino acids that most often serve as alkaloidal precursors include phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, his- tidine, anthranilic acid, lvsine, arid orni- thine. Some of the general reactions that are of particular importance include the do- carboxylation and transamination of the amino acids to yield a corresponding amine or aldehyde. These can react to form a Schiff base which, in turn, can react with a carbanion in a Mannich-type condensa- tion. These general reactions are illustrated in Figure 8-2. Specific examples of alkaloid biosynthesis are discussed under the var- ious structural groups of alkaloids. PYRIDINE-PIPERIDINE ALKALOIDS Upon reduction, the tertiary base, pyri- dine, is converted into the secondary base, piperidine. These 2 nuclei form the basis of this group, which is sometimes divided into 3 subgroups: (1) derivatives of piper- idine, including lobeline from lobelia; (2) derivatives of nicotinic acid, including arecoline from areca; and (3) derivatives of both py idine and pyrrolidine, including nicotine from tobacco. The important al- kaloidal drugs and their alkaloids that are classified in this group are areca, arecoline hydrobromii&e, lobelia, lobehne, and nic- otine. Biosynthesis of Pyridine-Piperidine Alkaloids Nicotine. More than 65 years ago, the Swiss chemist Trier proposed that nicotine 'a. was hiosynthesized from nicotinic acid and proline. If proline is considered a repre- sentative of the ornithinc-proline-glutarnic acid group, this remarkable hypothesis may he considered correct. However, nu- merous experiments conducted principally during the last 2 decades still have not clar- ified completely all of the reactions in- volved in the production of nicotine in Nicoliarta species. The biosynthetic path- ways leading to this compound are sum- marized in Figure 8-3. Tracer studies have shown that ornithine is incorporated into nicotine by tobacco plants - - his incorporation results in a sym- metric labeling pattern of nicotine. Putres- fine, i\-methylputrescine, and N-methyl- aminohutanal are all incorporated, and the key intermediate is thought to be the N-methvlpyrrolinium ion which, through elcctrophilic aromatic substitution, at- taches to C-3 of the pyridine ring of nico- tinic acid, Nicotinic acid is formed in higher plants and certain microorganisms via C0011 R--ÔHNH2 ,-amino acid COOH R' CHNH2 0-amino acid R—CH,NH7� HO�/R +� RNCH /�Schiff transammatioir�' -coo� base co, R M nni� / thTyp JRNH—CH H -C --H� "Alkaloid" Carbanion Fig. 8-2.
