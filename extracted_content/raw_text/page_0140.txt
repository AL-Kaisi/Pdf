, ALKALOIDS� 201 calcium carbonate or lime to produce an alkaline reaction. The mixture is crushed, kerosene or gasoline is added, and the mix- ture is stirred. After the leaf pulp is dis- carded, the kerosene is mixed with acidi- fied water,:-and the aqueous layer is separated and made alkaline with ammo- nia or baking soda, which precipitates a thick, aromatic paste containing not only cocaine but also several other alkaloids. The smoking of coca paste has become a drug abuse problem in Peru, Bolivia, Col- ombia, and Ecuador. Cocaine was first isolated in 1860, but until 1884, coca was considered only as an inferior substitute for tea. In that year, Koller discovered its local anesthetic prop- erties. Coca leaves contain 3 basic types of al- kaloids: derivatives of ecgonine (cocaine, cinnamylcocaine, (Y- and 3-tmxilline), tro- pine (tropacocaine, valerine), and hygrine (hygroline, cuscohygrine). Only the ecgo- nine derivatives are commercially impor- tant. The composition of the alkaloid mix- ture in the leaf varies qualitatively and quantitatively according to the variety of the plant and, to some extent, to the stage of development of the leaves when col- lected. Huanuco coca contains 0.5 to 1% of ester alkaloids, derivatives of tropine and ec- gonine, of which cocaine constitutes the major part. Cuscohygririe is the principal nonester alkaloid in the leaf. Truxillo coca has a somewhat lower con- tent of ester alkaloids, but a much higher percentage (up to 75%) of this quantity is cocaine. Coca leaves were highly valued by the natives long before the Spanish conquest; the shrub was known as "The Divine Plant of the Incas." Monardes published an ex- tensive article on the drug in 1569. The na- tives chew the leaf, either as such or mixed with lime (Fig. 8-8) and are thus able to travel great distances without experiencing fatigue and without any but the most mea- ger food rations. At present, coca chewing is an integral part of the native culture pattern in many isolated highland areas of Colombia and in most of the mountainous sections of Peru, Bolivia, and the northwestern part of Ar- gentina. Its use has spread from these areas to the lowlands and is prevalent in most parts of the northwestern Amazon valley in Colombia and Peru. Much has been written about the effect this habit has on its practitioners. Dr. R.E. Schultes, the well-known ethnobotanist at Harvard University, expressed the follow- ing opim... "What is very commonly overlooked or even purposely ignored in many govern- mental and sociologic circles is the fact that coca as chewed by the native is not of ne- cessity physically, socially, and morally dangerous. It has nothing in common with cocaine addiction, and coca chewing does not lead to addiction.... Unwise legal prohibitions in certain Andean areas aimed at extirpation of the coca custom have in- variably driven the Indian, deprived in his inhospitable cold altitudes of the euphoric coca, to the dangerously poisonous local distilled drinks with an attendant rapid rise in crime." Cocaine is an alkaloid obtained from the leaves of Erithroxy1uni coca and its varieties. As explained subsequently, much of the alkaloid is actually prepared by semisyn- thesis from plant-derived ecgonine. CH3 COCH3 (—)-Cocaine Cocaine is the methyl ester of benzoyl- ecgoriine. When hydrolyzed, it splits into ecgonine, benzoic acid, and methyl alco- hol. Cinnamylcocaine splits into ecgonine, methyl alcohol, and cinnamic acid, whereas a- and -truxilline split into cc- gonine, methyl alcohol, and a- and 3-trux-
