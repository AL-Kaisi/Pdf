Carbohydrate metabolism 194 values’ may not be applicable. This may be due to a circadian variation in islet cell responsiveness. ● Drug Steroids, oral contraceptives and thiazide diuretics may impair glucose tolerance. HYPOGLYCAEMIA (FIG. 12.9) By definition, hypoglycaemia is present if the plasma glucose concentration is less than 2.5 mmol/L in a specimen collected into a tube containing an inhibitor of glycolysis, for example fluoride oxalate. Blood cells continue to metabolize glucose in vitro, and low concentrations found in a specimen collected without such an inhibitor can be dangerously misleading (pseudohypoglycaemia). Symptoms of hypoglycaemia may develop at higher concentrations if there has been a rapid fall from a previously raised value, when adrenaline secretion is stimulated and may cause sweating, tachycardia and agitation. As discussed earlier, cerebral metabolism depends on an adequate supply of glucose from ECF, and the symptoms of hypoglycaemia may resemble those of cerebral hypoxia (neuroglycopenia). Faintness, dizziness or lethargy may progress rapidly to coma and, if untreated, permanent cerebral damage or death may occur. Existing cerebral or cerebrovascular disease may aggravate the clinical picture. Whipple’s triad is deﬁ ned as hypoglycaemia, neuroglycopenic symptoms, and relief of these symptoms on raising the blood glucose.
