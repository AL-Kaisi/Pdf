ALKALOIDS� 245 contractions, and a weak positive chrono- tropic and inotropic effect on the heart. Caffeine is synthesized from the same precursors in Coffea arbacia as are the purine bases in all other biologic systems that have been investigated. Carbon atoms 2 and 8 derive either from formate or from any compound that can give rise to an active 1-carbon fragment (serine, glycine, for- maldehyde, and methanol). These same compounds, as well as methionine, are ac- tive precursors of the N-methyl groups of the molecule. Carbon atom 6 is derived from carbon dioxide, and carbons 4 and 5, together with the nitrogen at 7, are derived from glycine. The nitrogen atom at position I derives from aspartic acid, but those in positions 3 and 9 originate from the amide nitrogen of glutamine. The drugs of this group are coffee, caf- feine, guarana, kola, mate, tea, theophyl- line, cocoa, and theobromine. co, Asparfc acid \ 0� CH, H C \ '� C1 Fragments I 'N(a� NH,- CH, 9 Gycne C Fragments CH3 ' Amide N of gIutmie Caffeine Caffeine-Containing Drugs Kola, cola, or kolanuts is the dried cot- yledon of Cola nitida (Ventenat) Schott et Endlicher, or of other species of Cola (Fam. Sterculiaceac). It yields not less than 1% of anhydrous caffeine. Kolanut is important because of its caffeine content and its fla- vor. Its principal use in the United States is in the manufacture of nonalcoholic bev- erages. In the tropical countries where it grows, the fresh nut is chewed as a Stim- ulant, similar to the betel nut (see page 190), C. nitida is a large tree indigenous to West Africa between Sierra Leone and the Congo. It is also cultivated in East Africa, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Brazil, and the West Indies, particularly in Jamaica. The com- mercial supplies come chiefly from culti- vated plants that grow in West Africa and in the West Indies. Kola nuts in Jamaica are harvested twice a year when the pods ripen (May and June and again in October and November). The chocolate-colored pods, which range from 5 to 10 cm in length, are shaken from the tree and gathered immediately. The seeds are removed from the pods, and the outer coat is cut off, exposing the bare cotyle- dons. These cotyledons are then carefully graded because only sound cotyledons do not deteriorate quickly. Fresh kolanuts tend to mold and spoil rather easily; they must be transported to the markets quickly for local consumption. Kolanuts prepared for shipment to the United States are split in half, dried in the sun, and shipped in bags. Kolanuts contain caffeine, up to 3.5%, and theobromine, less than 1%. In the fresh nuts, these purine derivatives are bound to the tannin, kolacatechin. During the drying process, the complex is split, yielding free caffeine and theohromjne and converting the colorless kolacatechin to the red-brown kola red. USE. Kola possesses the central stimulat- ing action of caffeine. It is an ingredient in several carbonated beverages. Coffee bean or coffee seed is the dried, ripe seed of Coffea arabica Liriné or C. liherica Hiern (Fam. Rubiacae), deprived of most of the seed coat. Roasted coffee is coffee roasted until it acquires a dark brown color and develops the characteristic aroma. The plants are small evergreen trees or shrubs with lanceolate, acuminate, entire, slightly coriaceous, dark green, short pet- iolate leaves, which are partly united with the short interpetiolar stipules at the base. The name Coffea is from the Turkish qahveh or the Arabic qahuah, the name of a bev- erage. The coffee plant is indigenous to Ethiopia and other parts of eastern Africa
