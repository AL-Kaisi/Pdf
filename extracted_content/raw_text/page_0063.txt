of ribose, and the only difference in structure is the epimeric hydroxyl group at the 2�-position of the pentose sugar. This epimeric sugar is similar enough to the natural ribose to allow ara-C to be incorporated into DNA, and its mecha- nism of action may include a slowing of the DNA chain elongation reaction via DNA polymerase or cellular ineffi- ciencies in DNA processing or repair after incorporation. Gemcitabine59 is the result of fluorination of the 2�-posi- tion of the sugar moiety. Gemcitabine is the 2�,2�-difluoro deoxycytidine species and after its anabolism to diphosphate and triphosphate metabolites, it inhibits ribonucleotide re- ductase and competes with 2�-deoxycytidine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA. The mechanism of action for gemcitabine is likely similar to that of ara-C including alter- ation of the rate of incorporation into DNA as well as the rate of DNA processing and repair. Modification of the pyrimidine ring has also been ex- plored for the development of potential anticancer drugs based on antimetabolite theory. Several pyrimidine nucleo- side analogs have one more or one less nitrogen in the hete- rocyclic ring. They are known as azapyrimidine or deaza- pyrimidine nucleosides. 5-Azacytidine is an example of a drug in this category (see Fig. 10.8). This compound was de- veloped via organic synthesis and later found as a natural product of fungal metabolism. The mode of action of this compound is complex involving reversible inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, and this lack of methylated DNA activates tumor suppressor genes. In certain tumor systems, it is incorporated into nucleic acids, which may result in misreading or processing errors. Purine Drugs The anticancer drugs based on purine structure are shown in Figure 10.9. The design of antimetabolites based on purine structure began with isosteric thiol/sulfhydryl group to replace the 6-hydroxyl group of hypoxanthine and guanine. One of the early successes was 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), the thiol analog of hypoxanthine.60 This purine re- quires bioactivation to its ribonucleotide, 6-thioinosinate (6-MPMP), by the enzyme HGPRT. The resulting nu- cleotide (Scheme 10.22) is a potent inhibitor of an early step in basic purine biosynthesis, the conversion of 5-phos- phoribosylpyrophosphate into 5-phosphoribosylamine (see Scheme 10.16). The ribose diphosphate and triphosphates of 6-mercaptopurine are active enzyme inhibitors, and the triphosphate can be incorporated into DNA and RNA to in- hibit chain elongation.61 However, the major antineoplastic action of 6-MP appears to be related to the inhibition of purine biosynthesis. Thioguanine (6-TG) is the 6-mercapto analog of guanine, analogous to 6-MP. Thioguanine is converted into its ribonu- cleotide by the same enzyme that acts on 6-mercaptopurine. It is converted further into the diphosphates and triphos- phates. These species inhibit most of the same enzymes that are inhibited by 6-mercaptopurine.62 Thioguanine is also in- corporated into RNA, and its 2�-deoxy metabolite is incorpo- rated into DNA. The incorporation into RNA and DNA and the subsequent disruption of these polymers may account for a greater portion of the antineoplastic activity of thioguanine compared with 6-MP.63 378 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 10.9 Anticancer drugs based on purines and related compounds.
