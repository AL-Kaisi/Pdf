this binding is the formation of single-strand breaks most no- tably at replication forks that occur during the S phase. Strand breakage of the leading strand of DNA during repli- cation results in double-strand breakage and ultimately leads to cell death. Several mechanisms of resistance to the camptothecin analogs are known. Different neoplasms express different levels of topoisomerase I, and this is thought to explain the susceptibility of any specific cancer to these agents. It is also possible for cells to decrease their expression of this enzyme or develop altered forms to which these compounds can no longer bind. Increased DNA-repair enzymes may limit the damage to DNA, and these agents are susceptible to Pgp- mediated efflux. The agents have also been shown to acti- vate nuclear factor-�B (NF-�B), which has an antiapoptotic effect so that strand breaks may not initiate apoptosis. Irinotecan undergoes hydrolysis of its carbamate moiety by irinotecan-converting enzyme to give SN-38, which is 1,000 times more potent than the parent compound (Scheme 10.29).110 There is wide interpatient variability in the extent of this transformation, which may explain differential re- sponses to the agent. Further metabolism involves the glu- curonidation (isozyme UGT1A1) of the resulting phenolic function of SN-38 to give SN-38G, which is inactive. An additional metabolite forms as a result of CYP3A4- mediated conversion to [4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1- piperidino]carbonylcamptothecin (APC), which is 100 times less active than SN-38. There is also the additional complication that the parent and metabolites may exist as the lactones or as the inactive hydroxy acid forms. IRINOTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE (CPT-11, CAMPTOSAR) Irinotecan is available in 100-mg or 5-mL vials for IV ad- ministration and is used in combination with 5-FU and leu- covorin as first-line treatment of metastatic colon cancer. The agent may also be used as a single agent in colorectal cancer as a second-line therapy when 5-FU therapy has failed. Additional uses include small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, and gastric can- cer. Irinotecan is 30% to 60% plasma protein bound, whereas the active metabolite SN-38 is 95% protein bound. Binding of SN-38 as the lactone stabilizes the material to ring open- ing. The elimination of the agent occurs primarily in the bile with a minor amount of renal elimination. The excretion of active metabolites or inactive metabolites such as the glu- curonide SN-38G, which may be converted back to SN-38 in the bile, has been associated with severe diarrhea. Irinotecan and SN-38 have half-lives of 8 and 14 hours, respectively. Irinotecan has two dose-limiting toxicities, myelosuppres- sion and diarrhea. The diarrhea occurs in two forms, early and late. The early form occurs within the first 24 hours after administration. It has been associated with inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which results in increased gut motility. This early phase is also associated with flushing, abdominal pain, and excessive sweating. Atropine can be used to relieve these symptoms but it is not recommended for prophylactic use unless there has been a prior episode. The late-phase diarrhea occurs after 24 hours and has been associated with the presence of active material, particularly SN-38 in the gut, and may last 3 to 10 days. The prolonged nature may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Loperamide therapy is recommended at the first appearance of a loose stool. If the diarrhea persists, additional agents may be used including antibiotics that decrease �-glucosidase–producing bacteria in the gut and prevent the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria.111 Other toxicities include emesis and alopecia. TOPOTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE (HYCAMPTAMINE, TOPO, HYCAMTIN) Topotecan is supplied in 4-mg vials and administered IV for the treatment of ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and small cell lung cancer in those patients who did not respond to first-line therapy. Following IV administration, the drug is widely distributed with 10% to 35% of the agent bound to plasma proteins. There is evidence that the agent may cross the blood-brain barrier to some extent. In plasma, an equilib- rium is established between the lactone and the less active hydroxy acid with 20% of the drug present as the lactone 1 hour after the infusion is complete.
