of the microtubule, shortening or depolymerization is pre- vented. The ends of the microtubules are differentiated by the activity that is occurring and are designated as plus and minus. When the microtubule elongates and shortens, it does so primarily at the plus end. The minus end undergoes less pronounced changes in length and is normally attached to a microtubule-organizing center. In a process known as “dynamic instability,” the ends go through phases of slow prolonged growth and rapid shortening, such that the over- all length changes. In the process of treadmilling, there is growth at one end counterbalanced by shortening at the other, such that the overall length does not change apprecia- bly. Both of these processes are important for the cell to suc- cessfully complete mitosis.123 As the cell prepares for mitosis, the microtubules that make up the cytoskeleton are degraded and reassembled into the mitotic spindle. During prometaphase, the microtubules grow out from the spindle poles to connect to the kineto- chores of the individual chromosomes. This involves both polymerization of tubulin and depolymerization as the mi- crotubule seeks out the chromosome representing a period of dynamic instability. These processes continue as the chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, and during this alignment, treadmilling occurs.124 Chromosomes are subsequently moved to the spindle poles during anaphase as microtubules attached to the spindle poles shorten and other microtubules known as intepolar microtubules lengthen. The vincas bind to tubulin in a reversible manner at sites different from those at which other inhibitors of spindle function bind including the podophyllotoxins and the taxanes. Combinations of these agents may give synergistic effects because of their unique binding sites. X-ray studies indicate that vinblastine binds between the �- and �-tubulin heterodimers and other studies have shown that there are both high-affinity binding sites located at the end of the spindle and low-affinity sites located along the intact spin- dle.125,126 Binding at the high-affinity sites prevents both lengthening and shortening of the spindle and thereby dis- rupts its function. Both dynamic instability and treadmilling are inhibited by the vinca alkaloids. Binding at low-affinity sites, which occurs at higher drug concentration, leads to breakdown of the spindle as tubulin depolymerizes. Initial binding at these low-affinity sites leads to an alteration in structure that exposes additional vinca-binding sites. The in- tracellular concentration of the drug then determines which of these effects is seen. As a result of these actions, the mi- totic spindle fails to form properly, chromosomes do not move to the metaphase plate, anaphase fails to occur, and the cell undergoes apoptosis.127 The agents are considered specific for the M phase of the cell cycle. Other activities have been observed including antimetabolite activity, inhi- bition of protein synthesis, and altered lipid metabolism, but these are only seen at very high concentrations of the drugs. Inhibition of angiogenesis has also been associated with the vinca alkaloids.128 Microtubules also play important roles in axons or nerve fibers, and disruption of this function is thought to be re- sponsible for the neuropathies seen with this group of com- pounds. This seems to be most pronounced for vincristine and presumably represents a greater affinity for this type of microtubule. The specific effects the vincas have on axonal microtubules is not as well defined as it is for the mitotic spindle. Resistance to the vinca alkaloids occurs by several differ- ent mechanisms that are also associated with resistance to several high–molecular-weight molecules with diverse mechanisms of action also used in treating cancer.129 This multidrug resistance (MDR) is also seen with the taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins, and the anthracyclines although the resistance is usually greatest to the principal agent to which the patient was exposed. The MDR has been associated with several proteins including permeability glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP1), which function to actively secrete the molecules from the cell. There are sev- eral inhibitors of Pgp such as calcium channel blockers and cyclosporine, which have been investigated to decrease drug efflux; however, these first-generation inhibitors were not successful in reducing drug efflux. There are several newer agents that have proven to be more potent inhibitors of Pgp, but none is currently approved. An additional mechanism of resistance involves altered forms of tubulin to which the vincas fail to bind. VINBLASTINE SULFATE (VLB, VELBAN, VELSAR) Vinblastine sulfate is available as a powder in 10-mg vials and as a solution in 10- and 25-mL vials for IV administra- tion in the treatment of various cancers including Hodgkin’s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, ad- vanced mycosis fungoides, advanced testicular carcinoma, and Kaposi sarcoma. It has also been used in treating chorio- carcinoma and breast cancer when other therapies have failed. Vinblastine is part of the ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) regimen used in the treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This may be alter- nated with the MOPP regimen. Extravasation is a concern with the vincas and is treated by administration of hyaluronidase and application of heat. Hyaluronidase hy- drolyzes hyaluronic acid, a polysaccharide component of the connective tissue. In so doing, the drug may increase diffu- sion out of the area of extravasation more quickly, prevent- ing the buildup of toxic levels. Vinblastine is highly protein bound and metabolized by CYP to the 4-O-desacetyl metabolite, which has been shown to be active although only small amounts have been recovered in the bile and feces. The metabolism of the vinca alkaloids has not been well charac- terized. Vinblastine is eliminated primarily in the feces; however, little of the unchanged drug has been recovered. Metabolism appears to involve CYP3A but other than the desacetyl derivative, other metabolites have not been charac- terized. The elimination half-life for vinblastine is 25 hours. Like vinorelbine, myelosuppression is commonly seen with vinblastine and is dose limiting. Inflammation of the GI tract is more commonly seen with vinblastine than vincristine. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Other adverse effects include alopecia, secretion of antidiuretic hormone, headache, and depression. Neurotoxicity is mild compared with vincristine, but peripheral neuropathy may be seen. An additional manifestation of this neurotoxicity is hypertension related to disruption of autonomic function. VINCRISTINE SULFATE (LCR, VCR, LEUROCRISTINE, ONCOVIN) Vincristine sulfate is available as a 1-mg/mL solution in 1-, 2-, and 5-mL vials for IV administration in acute leukemia and as part of a multidrug regime for Hodgkin’s and Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 397
