TABLE 12–3 Nitrate and nitrite drugs used in the treatment of angina. Drug Dose Duration of Action Short­acting Nitroglycerin, sublingual 0.15–1.2 mg 10–30 minutes Isosorbide dinitrate, sublingual 2.5–5 mg 10–60 minutes Amyl nitrite, inhalant (obsolete) 0.18–0.3 mL 3–5 minutes Long­acting Nitroglycerin, oral sustained­action 6.5–13 mg per 6–8 hours 6–8 hours Nitroglycerin, 2% ointment, transdermal 1–1.5 inches per 4 hours 3–6 hours Nitroglycerin, slow­release, buccal 1–2 mg per 4 hours 3–6 hours Nitroglycerin, slow­release patch, transdermal 10–25 mg per 24 hours (one patch per day) 8–10 hours Isosorbide dinitrate, sublingual 2.5–10 mg per 2 hours 1.5–2 hours Isosorbide dinitrate, oral 10–60 mg per 4–6 hours 4–6 hours Isosorbide dinitrate, chewable oral 5–10 mg per 2–4 hours 2–3 hours Isosorbide mononitrate, oral 20 mg per 12 hours 6–10 hours Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) 50 mg per 12 hours 10–12 hours The hemodynamic effects of sublingual or chewable isosorbide dinitrate and the oral organic nitrates are similar to those of nitroglycerin given by the same routes. Although transdermal administration may provide blood levels of nitroglycerin for 24 hours or more, the beneficial hemodynamic effects usually do not persist for more than 8–10 hours. The clinical efficacy of slow­release forms of nitroglycerin in maintenance therapy of angina is thus limited by the development of tolerance. Therefore, a nitrate­free period of at least 8 hours between doses of long­acting and slow­release forms should be observed to prevent tolerance. OTHER NITRO­VASODILATORS Nicorandil is a nicotinamide nitrate ester that has vasodilating properties in normal coronary arteries but more complex effects in patients with angina. Studies in isolated myocytes indicate that the drug activates an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and reduces intracellular Ca2+ overload. Clinical studies suggest that it reduces both preload and afterload. It also provides some myocardial protection via preconditioning by activation of cardiac KATP channels. One large trial showed a significant reduction in relative risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary events in patients receiving the drug. Nicorandil is currently approved for use in the treatment of angina in Europe and Japan but has not been approved in the USA. Molsidomine is a prodrug that is converted to a nitric oxide–releasing metabolite. It is said to have efficacy comparable to that of the organic nitrates and is not subject to tolerance. Recent studies suggest that it may reduce cerebral vasospasm in stroke. CALCIUM CHANNEL­BLOCKING DRUGS
