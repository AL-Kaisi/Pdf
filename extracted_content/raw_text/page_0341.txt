slowly dissipating ophthalmic ointments, or by the use of ophthalmic inserts. Gels Extended Release Although ophthalmic dosage forms are discussed at length in Chapter 17, it is useful to note here certain prepara­ tions designed to extend drug action. The following are but two examples of proprietary products that use vis­ cosity-increasing agents to increase corneal contact time. Pilocarpine (Pilopine HS Gel, Alcon) employs Carbopol 940, a synthetic high molecular weight cross-linked poly­ mer of acrylic acid. Timolol maleate (Timoptic-XE, Merck) employs gellan gum (Gelrite), which forms a gel upon contact with the precorneal tear film. Ophthalmic Inserts Lacrisert Lacrisert (Merck) is a rod-shaped water-soluble form of hydroxypropyl cellulose. The insert is placed in the inferior cul-de-sac of the eye once or twice daily for the treatment of dry eyes. The inserts soften and slowly dissolve, thicken­ ing the precorneal tear film and prolonging the tear film breakup. Pilocarpine Insert Pilocarpine is available in a membrane-controlled res­ ervoir system that is used in the treatment of glaucoma. Pilocarpine is sandwiched between two EVA membranes. It also contains alginic acid, a seaweed carbohydrate, which serves as a carrier for pilocarpine. The small, clear device has a white annular border made of EVA copoly­ mer impregnated with titanium dioxide (pigment) that makes it easier for the patient to see. The insert is placed in the cul-de-sac, where it will float with the tears. The pilocarpine will diffuse from the device and exert its phar­ macologic effect (Figs. 20.10 and 20.11). The tear fluid penetrates the microporous membrane, dissolving the pilocarpine. The release rate of pilocarpine is in the range of 20 or 40 mg/h for 4 to 7 days. One advan­ tage to this system is enhanced compliance, as the patient does not have to remember to instill the drops and has no blurred vision or slight discomfort that occurs when apply­ ing drops to the eyes. The release rate of pilocarpine from the EVA system is shown in the following equation: where dm = ADKAC dt h dm/ dt is the release rate; D is the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the membrane; K is the partition coefficient, that is, the ratio of drug concentration at equilibrium inside the membrane to that outside the membrane; C HAPTE R 20 Novel Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Technologies 559 FIGURE 20.10. Ocusert ocular therapeutic systems are thin, flexible wafers placed under the eyelid to provide a week's dose of pilocarpine in the treatment of glaucoma. Ocusert systems cause less blurring of vision than do conventional pilocarpine eye drops, which must be administered four times daily. liC is the difference of the drug concentration between the inside and the outside walls of the membrane; and A and h are the area and thickness of the system, respectively. Under routine conditions, the concentration of the drug in the tears is negligible (2 to 3 mg/mL) compared to that inside the membrane, which is essentially the solubility of the drug, so the equation can be rewritten dm ADKS - = --- dt h The systems are designed to release at 20 or 40 mg/h for 1 week. Over a week's time, the total drug released by the system is 3.4 or 6. 7 mg, for the 20 or 40 mg/h units, respec­ tively. The units contain either 5 or 11 mg of drug initially �--------::;:, Pilocarpine reservoir Transpare<i � Annular ring rate-controlling = surroun�s membranes � reservrnr "' � Opaque white for visibility in handling and inserting system FIGURE 20.11.
