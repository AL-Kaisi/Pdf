result of an ionic interaction of the protonated amines with the phosphate backbone of DNA. The formation of covalent adducts with DNA have also been demonstrated to occur in a manner similar to the anthracyclines. In this case, how- ever, other enzymes such as myeloperoxidase are responsi- ble for the generation of formaldehyde.85 Topoisomerase II is inhibited, and strand breakage occurs similar to that seen with the anthracyclines. In contrast to the anthracyclines, mitoxantrone is not a substrate for the reductase enzymes re- sponsible for the conversion to the semiquinone so that ROS are not generated by this process.86 This lack of activation has been attributed to the presence of the side chains. This has the effect of reducing the cardiotoxicity but not com- pletely eliminating it, and caution should be used especially in those patients with existing cardiovascular problems. Individual Agents DACTINOMYCIN-D (ACT-D, ACTINOMYCIN-D, COSMEGEN, LYOVAC COSMEGEN) Dactinomycin is available in vials containing 0.5 mg of drug for reconstitution in sterile water for IV administration This antibiotic is most effective in the treatment of rhabdomyosar- coma and Wilms tumor in children as well as in the treatment of choriocarcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and testicular carcinoma. The pharmacokinetics of dactinomycin has not been well characterized, but it appears to concentrate in nucleated blood cells. The agent is 5% to 15% plasma protein bound and is excreted mostly unchanged in urine and bile. Other metabolites have not been characterized. The terminal elimination half-life is 30 to 40 hours. Myelosuppression is dose limiting with both leucopenia and thrombocytopenia being the most likely presentation. Nausea and vomiting occur shortly (2 hours) after treatment and may be severe. Mucositis and diarrhea also result from irritation of the GI tract. Hair loss is commonly associated with the agent as is hyperpigmentation of the skin and erythema. DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE (ADM, ADR, ADRIA, ADRIAMYCIN) Doxorubicin is available as both the conventional dosage form and a liposomal preparation, both of which are admin- istered by infusion. Doxorubicin HCl powder is available in 10-, 20-, 50-, and 150-mg vials and is widely used in treat- ing various cancers, including leukemias, soft and bone tis- sue sarcomas, Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and ovarian and testicular cancer. Resistance to the agent involves decreased expression of topoisomerase II and mutations in this enzyme that decrease binding of the drug. The agent may also be actively secreted from cancer cells by Pgp. The agent is rapidly taken up into tissues following in- jection with a distributive half-life of 5 minutes followed by a slow elimination half-life of 20 to 48 hrs. The primary route of elimination is in the bile and feces. Metabolism in- volves reduction of the C-13 ketone to yield doxorubicinol (active) along with cleavage of the amino sugar to give the aglycone. The aglycones are also capable of undergoing redox cycling and producing ROS. The toxicities associated with doxorubicin include dose- limiting cardiotoxicity and myelosuppression. Most patients will experience alopecia and nausea. Cardiotoxicity is a lim- iting factor in the administration of doxorubicin, which, in its most severe form, may progress to CHF. This may occur during therapy or during months or years following the ter- mination of therapy. The percentage of patients that progress to CHF increases with increasing cumulative dose. The liposomal form of doxorubicin (Doxil) offers several advantages including an improved pharmacokinetic profile with slower plasma clearance giving a distributive half-life of 45 hours versus 5 minutes for doxorubicin and a smaller volume of distribution of 4 L versus 254 L for doxoru- bicin.87 There is also reportedly an increased uptake of doxorubicin in tumor cells, which has been attributed to the ability of the liposomes to break down in the more acidic en- vironment associated with tumor cells or by the release of enzymes from the tumor cells that degrade the liposomes. The liposomes decrease uptake by myocardial tissue, so car- diotoxicity is less common. The liposomes also reduce con- version to doxorubicinol, which has been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Additionally, there is a de- crease in the incidence of extravasation. Other adverse ef- fects are also decreased including less nausea, alopecia, and stomatitis although skin toxicity, which is normally seen as a rash on the feet and hands, may occur frequently. DAUNORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE (DAUNOMYCIN, DNM, DNR, CERUBIDINE, RUBIDOMYCIN) Daunorubicin is available in 20- and 100-mg vials for recon- stitution. The agent is given intravenously for the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic and lymphocytic leukemia. Other unlabeled uses include CML and Kaposi sarcoma. In gen- eral, its use is more limited than that of doxorubicin. Daunorubicin lacks the hydroxyl groups found at C-14 of doxorubicin. This leads to an increase in the amount of the alcohol metabolite daunorubicinol (active) arising as a result of reduction of the side chain ketone. This, however, does not appear to lead to a significant increase in the occurrence of cardiotoxicity compared with doxorubicin. The mecha- nisms of resistance and toxicities of daunorubicin are simi- lar to that of doxorubicin; the major difference between the two agents being the spectrum of cancers that they are used treat. A liposomal form of daunorubicin is also available known as DaunoXome. The drug offers the same advantages as those seen for the liposomal form of doxorubicin. EPIRUBRICIN HYDROCHLORIDE (4�-EPIADRIAMYCIN, EPI-ADR, ELLENCE) Epirubicin is available in 50- and 200-mg vials for IV ad- ministration for the treatment of breast cancer. It also has 388 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 10.14 Structure of mitoxantrone.
