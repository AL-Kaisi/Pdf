154 ANSEL'S PHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORMS AND DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS movement into or out of the compartment. The rate at which a drug is transferred throughout the system is des­ ignated by a symbol that usually represents an exponential rate constant. Typically, the letter K or k with numeric or alphanumeric subscripts is used. Several assumptions are associated with modeling of drug behavior in the body. It is assumed that the volume of each compartment remains constant. Thus, an equation that describes the time course of the amount of drug in the compartment can be converted to an equation that depicts the time course of the drug concentration in the compart­ ment by dividing both sides of the equation by the volume of the compartment. Second, it is assumed that once a drug enters the compartment, it is instantaneously and uniformly distributed throughout the entire compartment. Thus, it is assumed that a sampling of any one portion of the compartment will yield the drug concentration of the entire compartment. In compartment models, it is assumed that drug passes freely into and out of compartments. Thus, these com­ partmental systems are known as open systems. Typically, drug transport between compartments follows first-order kinetics, wherein a constant fraction of drug is eliminated per unit of time and can be described by ordinary dif­ ferential equations. In these linear systems, the time con­ stants that describe the rate at which the plasma or blood concentration curve of a drug decays are independent of the dose, the volume of distribution, and the route of administration. The simplest pharmacokinetic model is the single­ compartment open-model system (Fig. 5.12). This model depicts the body as one compartment characterized by a certain volume of distribution (Vct) that remains constant. Each drug has its own distinct volume of distribution, and this can be influenced by factors including age and disease status. In this scheme, a drug can be instantaneously intro­ duced into the compartment, that is, via rapid intravenous administration, or gradually, as with oral administration. In the former case, it is assumed that the drug distributes immediately to tissues and instantly attains equilibrium. In the latter case, the drug is absorbed at a certain rate and is characterized by the absorption rate constant K •. Finally, the drug is eliminated from the compartment at a certain rate that is characterized by an elimination rate constant, Ke1, It is relevant at this point to consider the volume of dis­ tribution, Vct, a proportionality constant that refers to the volume into which the total amount of drug in the body must be uniformly distributed to provide the concentra­ tion of drug actually measured in plasma or blood. This term can be misleading because it does not represent a specific body fluid or volume. It is influenced by the plasma protein binding and tissue binding of a drug. These then influence the distribution of the drug between plasma water, extracellular fluid, intracellular fluid, and total body water. Furthermore, because a drug can partition between fat and water according to its unique partition coefficient, 0 .0 .!: .0 0 0 800 600 400 200 Days Plateau values FIGURE 5.13. Plot of the plasma concentration-time data. (Adapted from Rowland M, Tozer TN. Clinical Pharmacokinetics. 2nd Ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lea & Febiger, 1 989, with permission.) this can also influence the volume of distribution. Because of these phenomena, pharmacokineticists find it conve­ nient to describe drug distribution in terms of compart­ mental models. To determine the rate of drug transfer into and out of the compartment, plasma, serum, or blood samples are drawn at predetermined times after the drug is administered and analyzed for drug concentration. Once a sufficient num­ ber of experimental data points are determined, these are plotted on semilogarithmic paper, and an attempt is made to fit the experimental points with a smooth curve. Figure 5.13 depicts the plasma concentration-time profile for a hypothetical drug following rapid intravenous injection of a bolus dose of the drug with instantaneous distribu­ tion. For drugs whose distribution follows first-order one­ compartment pharmacokinetics, a plot of the logarithm of the concentration of drug in the plasma (or blood) versus time will yield a straight line. The equation that describes the plasma decay curve is Equation 5.1 where K,,1 is the first-order rate of elimination of the drug from the body, CP is the concentration of the drug at a time equal to t, and C� is the concentration of drug at time equal to zero, when all the drug administered has been absorbed but none has been removed from the body through elimina­ tion mechanisms, for example, metabolism and renal excretion. The apparent first-order rate of elimination, K,,1, is usu­ ally the sum of the rate constants of a number of individual processes, for example, metabolic transformation and renal excretion. For the purpose of pharmacokinetic calculation, it is simpler to convert Equation 5.1 to natural logs: LnCP = LnC� -Ket ( t) Equation 5.2
