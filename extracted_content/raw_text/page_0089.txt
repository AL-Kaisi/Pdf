the enzyme similar to imatinib. Subsequent x-ray analysis of the drug receptor complex showed that the pyridine ring occupied the ATP-binding site of Raf, whereas the trifluo- romethyl-chloro–substituted phenyl ring occupied a hy- drophobic pocket in the cleft formed by the two lobes of the protein.153 The urea moiety forms two hydrogen bonds, one through interaction of the amide proton with the carboxylate of Glu500 and the second through interaction of the car- bonyl oxygen with the peptide amide N-H of Asp593. The compound also has the capacity to inhibit several other TKs associated with growth factor receptors including PDGF-R, VEGF-R, RET-kinase, and c-Kit with IC50s in the range of 20 to 90 nM. In some cancer models, the compound has been shown to be effective even though the MAPK pathway was not inhibited and this has been explained by the com- pounds inhibition of angiogenesis This has been attributed to the effects on inhibition of PDGF-R and VEGF-R phos- phorylation and the role these growth factor receptors play in the creation of new blood vessels. The agent was investi- gated and subsequently approved for use in renal cell carci- noma (RCC) because of the fact that this particular cancer is often associated with increased activity of the targets inhib- ited by sorafenib and the high level of neoangiogenesis that is seen in this cancer. As a group of agents, the protein kinase inhibitors have the advantage of oral administration and better patient tol- erability. The major adverse effects include a skin rash that normally appears early in therapy on the upper torso and is generally mild but may become more serious in some cases. Mild diarrhea and nausea are also commonly seen but are 404 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 10.26 Protein kinase inhibitors.
