They may be relatively new, use new or relatively new delivery systems, or use unique delivery systems or unique devices before, during, or after admin­ istration. Dramatic changes have been introduced, with new technology and new devices now on the market. In some cases, traditional capsules and ointments have been replaced by osmotic pumps, wearable ambulatory pumps, electrically assisted drug delivery, and a host of other delivery methods based on various polymer technologies. Feedback mechanisms are now feasible: Actual drug deliv­ ery may be a response to a sensor detecting variations in certain body chemicals and prompting infusion of a drug to correct the imbalance. 550 Changes are coming about as new technologies are developed and reduce the limitations of existing thera­ pies. In some cases, the new drugs require new delivery systems because the traditional systems are inefficient or ineffective; this may be true especially of some of the recombinant DNA and gene therapies of the future. We may soon be manipulating genes as active drugs and as drug delivery systems and even work in nanotechnol­ ogy (nanopharmacy) in the future. Some therapies may become very site specific and require very high concentra­ tions of drugs in selected sites of the body, as more con­ trolled drug delivery systems will be available in the very near future. Traditional oral medications may not be as effective in some of these cases. New drug delivery system development is largely based on promoting the therapeutic effects of a drug and mini­ mizing its toxic effects by increasing the amount and persistence of a drug in the vicinity of a target cell and
