Rule of Five.41,42 A candidate molecule is more likely to have poor absorption or permeability if: 1. The molecular weight exceeds 500. 2. The calculated octanol/water partition coefficient ex- ceeds 5. 3. There are more than 5 H-bond donors expressed as the sum of O–H and N–H groups. 4. There are more than 10 H-bond acceptors expressed as the sum of N and O atoms. Because of misses when searching or mining databases, there have been two suggested changes. The first of these is to take into account the fact that many compounds will be significantly ionized at physiological pH and, therefore, use the distribution coefficient log D with an upper limit of 5.5 rather than a log P of 5.43 Similar results have been found when evaluating herbicides and pesticides.44 A second sug- gested modification of the Rule of Five gives specific ranges for log P, molar refractivity, molecular weight and number of atoms (Table 2.10).45 The rapid evaluation of large numbers of molecules is sometimes called high-throughput screening (Fig. 2.26). The screening can be in vitro, often measuring how well the tested molecules bind to cloned receptors or enzyme active sites. Robotic devices are available for this testing. Based on the results, the search for viable structures is narrowed, and new compounds are synthesized. The criteria for activity will be based on structure and physicochemical values. QSAR, including 3D-QSAR, models can be developed to aid in designing new active ligands. Alternatively, the search may be virtual. Again starting with the same type of database and the dimensions of the active site, the ability of the compounds in the database to fit or bind is estimated. The virtual receptor will include both its dimensions and physicochemical characteristic. Keeping in mind that the receptor is a protein, there will be hydrogen bond acceptors and donors (serine, threonine, tyrosine), posi- tively and negatively charged side chains (lysine, histidine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid), nonpolar or hydrophobic side chains (leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine), and induced dipoles (phenylalanine, tyrosine). The type of groups that will be attracted or repulsed by the type of amino acid side chain is coded into the chemical database. The virtual screening will lead to development of a refined model for good binding, and the search is repeated. When the model is considered valid, it must be tested by actual screening in biological test systems and by synthesizing new compounds to test its validity. Another approach to searching a database of compounds is the use of the chemical fragments described earlier. There is ongoing debate regarding what type of fragments will result in the most hits. Nevertheless, there now are fragment libraries constructed around the range of the frag- ments’ physicochemical properties, solubilities, molecular diversity, and drug likeness based on their presence in ex- isting compounds.46 38 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry TABLE 2.10 Suggested Modifications to the Lipinski Rule of Five Druglike Preferred Range Range Mean Log P �0.4–5.6 1.3–4.1 2.3 Molar Refractivity 40–130 70–110 97 Molecular Weight 160–480 230–390 360 No. of Atom 20–70 30–55 48 Source: Ghose, A.
