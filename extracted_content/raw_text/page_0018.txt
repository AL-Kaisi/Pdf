cell. The cellular membranes are dynamic, with the channels forming and disappearing depending on the cell’s and body’s needs (Fig. 2.11). So complex is this system that it is not uncommon to have situations where there is poor corre- lation between the partition coefficient of a series of mole- cules and the biological response.2 In addition, the membranes on the surface of nucleated cells have specific antigenic markers, major histocompatibil- ity complex (MHC), by which the immune system monitors the cell’s status. There are receptors on the cell surface where hormones such as epinephrine and insulin bind, setting off a series of biochemical events within the cell. Some of these re- ceptors are used by viruses to gain entrance into the cells, where the virus reproduces. As newer instrumental tech- niques are developed, and genetic cloning permits isolation of the genetic material responsible for forming and regulating the structures on the cell surface, the image of a passive lipid membrane has disappeared to be replaced by a very complex, highly organized, dynamically functioning structure. For purposes of the partitioning phenomenon, picture the cellular membranes as two layers of lipids (Fig. 2.9). The two outer layers, one facing the interior and the other facing the exterior of the cell, consist of the polar ends of the bifunc- tional lipids. Keep in mind that these surfaces are exposed to an aqueous polar environment. The polar ends of the charged phospholipids and other bifunctional lipids are solvated by the water molecules. There are also considerable amounts of charged proteins and mucopolysaccharides present on the sur- face. In contrast, the interior of the membrane is populated by the hydrophobic aliphatic chains from the fatty acid esters. With this representation in mind, a partial explanation can be presented as to why the n-octanol/water partitioning system seems to mimic the lipid membranes/water systems found in the body. It turns out that n-octanol is not as non- polar as initially might be predicted. Water-saturated octanol contains 2.3 M water because the small water molecule easily clusters around octanol’s hydroxy moiety. n- Octanol–saturated water contains little of the organic phase because of the large hydrophobic 8-carbon chain of octanol. The water in the n-octanol phase apparently approximates the polar properties of the lipid bilayer, whereas the lack of octanol in the water phase mimics the physiological aqueous compartments, which are relatively free of nonpolar compo- nents. In contrast, partitioning systems such as hexane/water and chloroform/water contain so little water in the organic phase that they are poor models for the lipid bilayer/water system found in the body. At the same time, remember that the n-octanol/water system is only an approximation of the actual environment found in the interface between the cel- lular membranes and the extracellular/intracellular fluids. Experimental determination of octanol/water partition coef- ficients is tedious and time consuming. Today, most are calculated. The accuracy of these calculations is only as good as the assumptions made by the writers of the software. These include atomic fragment values, correction factors, spatial properties, effects of resonance and induction, inter- nal secondary bonding forces, etc. There are over 30 differ- ent software packages for calculating a molecules partition coefficient, and their accuracy varies widely.3,4 Other Physicochemical and Descriptor Parameters There is a series of other descriptors that measure the contri- bution by substituents to the molecule’s total physicochemi- cal properties. These include Hammett’s � constant; Taft’s steric parameter, Es; Charton’s steric parameter, v; Verloop’s multidimensional steric parameters, L, B1, B5; and molar re- fractivity, MR, number of hydrogen bond donors and accep- tors, pKa, polar surface area, number of rotatable bonds, connectivity indices, and the list goes into the thousands. Although directories of these have been published, it is com- mon to calculate them. Table 2.6 lists a very small set and illustrates several items that must be kept in mind when se- lecting substituents to be evaluated in terms of the type of factors that influence a biological response. For electronic pa- rameters such as �, the location on an aromatic ring is impor- tant because of resonance versus inductive effects. Notice the twofold differences seen between �meta and �para for the three aliphatic substituents and iodo, and severalfold difference for methoxy, amino, fluoro, and phenolic hydroxyl. Selection of substituents from a certain chemical class may not really test the influence of a parameter on biological activity. There is little numerical difference among the �meta or �para values for the four aliphatic groups or the four halo- gens. It is not uncommon to go to the tables and find missing parameters such as the Es values for acetyl and N-acyl. 20 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry TABLE 2.6 Sampling of Physicochemical Parameters Used in Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationships Investigations Substituent Group � �meta �para Es MR MH 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.03 MCH3 0.56 �0.07 �0.17 �1.24 5.65 MCH2CH3 1.02 �0.07 �0.15 �1.31 10.30 MCH2CH2CH3 1.55 �0.07 �0.13 �1.60 14.96 MC(CH3)2 1.53 �0.07 �0.15 �1.71 14.96 MOCH3 �0.02 0.12 �0.27 �0.55 7.87 MNH2 �1.23 �0.16 �0.66 �0.61 5.42 MF 0.14 0.34 0.06 �0.46 0.92 MCl 0.71 0.37 0.23 �0.97 6.03 MBr 0.86 0.39 0.23 �1.16 8.88 MI 1.12 0.35 0.18 �1.40 13.94 MCF3 0.88 0.43 0.54 �2.40 5.02 MOH �0.67 0.12 �0.37 �0.55 2.85 MCOCH3 �0.55 0.38 0.50 11.18 MNHCOCH3 �0.97 0.21 0.00 14.93 MNO2 �0.8 0.71 0.78 �2.52 7.36 MCN �0.57 0.56 0.66 �0.51 6.33 Reprinted with permission from Hansch, C., and Leo, A.
