Disanto, Upjohn.) 2.0 mg/mL and the minimum toxic concentration (MTC) is 4.0 mg/mL, as depicted in Figure 5. 7, equal doses of the two formulations result in toxic effects produced by formulation A but only desired effects by formulation B. The objective in the individual dosing of a patient is to achieve the MEC but not the MTC. The size of the dose influences the blood level concen­ tration and Cmax for that substance. Figure 5.8 depicts the influence of dose on the blood level-time curve for a hypo­ thetical drug administered by the same route and in the same dosage form. In this example, it is assumed that all doses are completely absorbed and eliminated at the same rates. As the dose increases, the Cmax is proportionately C 0 � C C) ::::, ""C 0 0 0 A Minimum effective concentration Time FIGURE 5.8.

Time of Peak The second important parameter in assessing the com­ parative bioavailability of two formulations is T max• In Figure 5.6, Tmax is 1 hour for formulation A and 4 hours for formulation B. This parameter reflects the rate of absorption from a formulation, which determines the time needed for the MEC to be reached and thus for initiation of the desired effect. The rate of absorption also influences the period over which the drug enters the bloodstream and therefore affects the duration that the drug is maintained in the blood. In Figure 5.7, formulation A allows the drug to reach the MEC within 30 minutes following administration and a peak concentration in 1 hour. Formulation B has a slower rate of release. Drug from this formulation reached the MEC 2 hours after administration and its peak concen­ tration 4 hours after administration. Thus, formulation A permits the greater rate of drug absorption; it allows drug to reach both the MEC and its peak height sooner than does formulation B. On the other hand, formulation B pro­ vides more time for drug concentrations maintained above the MEC, 8 hours (2 to 10 hours following administration) compared to 5.5 hours (30 minutes to 6 hours following administration) for formulation A. Thus, if a rapid onset of action is desired, a formulation similar to A is preferred, but if a long duration rather than a rapid onset of action is desired, a formulation similar to B is preferred. In summary, changes in the rate of drug absorption change the values of both Cmax and Tmax• Each product has its own characteristic rate of absorption. When the rate of absorption is decreased, the Cmax is lowered and T max occurs at a later time. If the doses of the drugs are the same C ai
