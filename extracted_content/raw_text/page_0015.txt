ionization for ephedrine (pKa 9.6; Eq. 2.4) and in- domethacin (pKa 4.5; Eq. 2.3) at pH 3.5 (stomach), pH 8.0 (intestine), and pH 7.4 (plasma) (see examples 1, 6, and 7 in Table 2.2). Of course, the effect of protein binding, dis- cussed previously, can greatly alter any prediction of biodis- tribution based solely on pKa. COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN: EARLY METHODS Initially, the design of new drugs was based on starting with a prototypical molecule, usually a natural product and mak- ing structural modifications. Examples include steroidal hormones based on naturally occurring cortisone, testos- terone, progesterone and estrogen; adrenergic drugs based on epinephrine; local anesthetics based on cocaine; opiate analgesics based on morphine; antibiotics based on peni- cillin, cephalosporin and tetracycline. Examples of proto- typical molecules that were not natural in origin include the antipsychotic phenothiazines, bisphosphonates for osteo- porosis, benzodiazepines indicated for various CNS treat- ments. Although prototypical molecules have produced significant advancements in treating diseases, this approach to drug development is limited to the initial discovery of the prototypical molecule. Today, it is more common to take a holistic approach that, where possible, involves understand- ing the etiology of the disease and the structure of the recep- tor where the ligand (drug) will bind. Increasing computer power coupled with applicable software, both at reasonable cost, has lead to more focused approaches for the develop- ment of new drugs. Computational methodologies include mathematical equations correlating structure with biological activity, searching chemical databases for leads and rapid docking of ligand to the receptor. The latter requires 3D structure information of the receptor. Originally crystallized enzymes were the common receptors, and their spatial arrangements determined by x-ray crystallography. Today’s software can calculate possible 3D structures of protein starting with the amino acid sequence. Statistical Prediction of Pharmacological Activity Just as mathematical modeling is used to explain and model many chemical processes, it has been the goal of medicinal chemists to quantify the effect of a structural change on a de- fined pharmacological response. This would meet three goals in drug design: (a) to predict biological activity in untested compounds, (b) to define the structural requirements required for a good fit between the drug molecule and the receptor, and (c) to design a test set of compounds to maximize the amount of information concerning structural requirements for activity from a minimum number of compounds tested. This aspect of medicinal chemistry is commonly referred to as quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR). The goals of QSAR studies were first proposed about 1865 to 1870 by Crum-Brown and Fraser, who showed that the gradual chemical modification in the molecular structure of a series of poisons produced some important differences in their action.1 They postulated that the physiological ac- tion, �, of a molecule is a function of its chemical constitu- tion, C. This can be expressed in Equation 2.5: � � f(C) (Eq. 2.5) Equation 2.5 states that a defined change in chemical structure results in a predictable change in physiological ac- tion. The problem now becomes one of numerically defining chemical structure. It still is a fertile area of research. What has been found is that biological response can be predicted from physical chemical properties such as vapor pressure, water solubility, electronic parameters, steric descriptors, and partition coefficients (Eq. 2.6). Today, the partition coef- ficient has become the single most important physical chem- ical measurement for QSAR studies. Note that Equation 2.6 is the equation for a straight line (Y � mx � b). log BR � a(physical chemical property) � c (Eq. 2.6) where BR � a defined pharmacological response usually ex- pressed in millimoles such as the inhibitory constant Ki, the effective dose in 50% of the subjects (ED50), the lethal dose in 50% of the subjects (LD50), or the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). It is com- mon to express the biological response as a recipro- cal, 1/BR or 1/C a � the regression coefficient or slope of the straight line c � the intercept term on the y axis (when the physical chemical property equals zero) To understand the concepts in the next few paragraphs, it is necessary to know how to interpret defined pharmacolog- ical concepts such as the ED50, which is the amount of the drug needed to obtain the defined pharmacological response in 50% of the test subjects. Let us assume that drug A’s ED50 is 1 mmol and drug B’s ED50 is 2 mmol. Drug A is twice as potent as drug B. In other words, the smaller the ED50 (or ED90, LD50, MIC, etc.), the more potent is the sub- stance being tested. The logarithmic value of the dependent variable (concen- tration necessary to obtain a defined biological response) is used to linearize the data. As shown later in this chapter, QSARs are not always linear. Nevertheless, using logarithms is an acceptable statistical technique (taking reciprocals ob- tained from a Michaelis-Menton study produces the linear Lineweaver-Burke plots found in any biochemistry textbook). Now, why is the biological response usually expressed as a reciprocal? Sometimes, one obtains a statistically more valid relationship. More importantly, expressing the biolog- ical response as a reciprocal usually produces a positive slope (Fig. 2.7). Let us examine the following published example (Table 2.5). The BR is the LD100 (lethal dose in 100% of the subjects). The mechanism of death is general depression of the CNS.
