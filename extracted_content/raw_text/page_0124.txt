916 SECTION 15 | Respiratory Disorders • All patients on inhaled drugs should have their inhalation technique evaluated monthly initially and then every 3–6 months. • After initiation of anti-inflammatory therapy or increase in dosage, most patients should experience decreased symptoms within 1–2 weeks and achieve maximum improvement within 4–8 weeks. Improvement in baseline FEV1 or PEF should follow a similar time course, but decrease in BHR as measured by morning PEF, PEF vari- ability, and exercise tolerance may take longer and improve over 1–3 months. See Chapter 44, Asthma, authored by Kathryn V. Blake and Jean Y. Moon, for a more detailed discussion of this topic.
