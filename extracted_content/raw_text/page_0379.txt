Radical Damage May Cause Mutations, Cancer, Autoimmune Disease, & Atherosclerosis Radical damage to DNA in germline cells in ovaries and testes can lead to heritable mutations; in somatic cells, the result may be initiation of cancer. The dialdehydes formed as a result of radical-induced lipid peroxidation in cell membranes can also modify bases in DNA. Chemical modification of amino acids in proteins, either by direct radical action or as a result of reaction with the products of radical-induced lipid peroxidation, leads to proteins that are recognized as nonself by the immune system. The resultant antibodies will also cross-react with normal tissue proteins, so initiating autoimmune disease. Chemical modification of the proteins or lipids in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leads to abnormal LDL that is not recognized by the liver LDL receptors, and so is not cleared by the liver. The modified LDL is taken up by macrophage scavenger receptors. Lipid-engorged macrophages infiltrate under blood vessel endothelium (especially when there is already some dam- age to the endothelium), and are killed by the high content of unesterified cholesterol they have accumulated. This occurs in the development of atherosclerotic plaques, which, in extreme cases, can more or less completely occlude a blood vessel. Dr.Murtadha AlShareifi e-Library
