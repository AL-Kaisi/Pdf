The bulkier oxaliplatin-DNA adduct does not seem to be recognized by the same enzymes and does not depend on MMR enzymes for its cytotoxicity, and several cell lines that are resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin are still susceptible to oxaliplatin. In addition, several DNA polymerases are un- able to replicate past cisplatin-DNA adducts but are able to replicate past oxaliplatin-DNA adducts.27 This difference has been used to explain the greater mutagenicity that is seen with cisplatin compared with oxaliplatin. These two com- pounds both form primarily intrastrand links between adja- cent guanine residues or adjacent guanine–adenine residues; however, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis has recently shown that the amount of DNA bending is much greater, and the minor groove is widened for the cisplatin- DNA adduct compared with the oxaliplatin-DNA adduct. The greater bending associated with cisplatin-DNA adducts is recognized by MMR enzymes possibly explaining the differential effects of cisplatin and oxaliplatin on these enzymes. NITROSOUREAS The nitrosoureas were discovered as a result of drug screen- ing by the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center, which identified N-methyl-N�-nitroguanidine as having ac- tivity against L1210 leukemia.28 Further development of this lead compound was based on the idea that its chemical decomposition was leading to the formation of dia- zomethane (CH2N2) and subsequent alkylation of DNA. This led to the nitrosoureas, where it was found that activity could be enhanced by attachment of a 2-haloethyl sub- stituent to both nitrogens (Fig. 10.6). These compounds are reasonably stable at pH � 4.5 but undergo both acid and base catalyzed decomposition at lower and higher pH, respectively. There are several path- ways of decomposition that are possible for these com- pounds, but the one that appears to be most important for alkylation of DNA involves abstraction of the NH proton, which is relatively acidic (pKa � 8–9), followed by re- arrangement to give an isocyanate and a diazohydroxide. The diazohydroxide, upon protonation followed by loss of water, yields a diazo species that decomposes to a reactive carbocation (Scheme 10.11).22 The isocyanate functions to carbamylate proteins and RNA, whereas the carbocation is believed to be the agent responsible for DNA alkyla- tion.29–31 Alternative mechanisms of decomposition have also been proposed involving formation of chlorovinyl carbocations. In those cases where there is a chloroethyl moiety attached to the N-nitroso urea functionality, cross- linking of DNA occurs. Alkylation occurs preferentially at the N-7 position of guanine with minor amounts of alkyla- tion at guanine O-6.32 Detoxification pathways of the nitrosoureas are also pos- sible and can play a role in resistance to this group of agents. Two major routes of inactivation have been identified and are indicated in Scheme 10.12. The first of these involves dechlorination, which is facilitated by CYP participation and involves cyclization to give 4,5-dihydro-[1,2,3]oxadiazole and the isocyanate, which is still capable of carbamylating proteins.33 The oxadiazole can be further degraded by hy- drolysis to give several inactive products. The second route involves denitrosation, which in the case of BCNU (carmus- tine) has been shown to be catalyzed by CYP monooxygen- ases and glutathione-S-reductase.34 Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 365 Figure 10.5 Platinum-containing antineoplastics.
