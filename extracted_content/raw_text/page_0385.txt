Carbohydrate metabolism 178 Somatostatin This peptide hormone is released from the D cells of the pancreas and inhibits insulin and growth hormone release. Other hormones When plasma insulin concentrations are low, for example during fasting, the hyperglycaemic actions of hormones, such as growth hormone (GH), glucocorticoids, adrenaline (epinephrine) and glucagon, become apparent, even if there is no increase in secretion rates. Secretion of these so-called counter- regulatory hormones may increase during stress and in patients with acromegaly (GH, see Chapter 6), Cushing’s syndrome (glucocorticoids, see Chapter 8) or in phaeochromocytoma (adrenaline and noradrenaline see Chapter 24) and thus oppose the normal action of insulin. The liver The liver is the most important organ maintaining a constant glucose supply for other tissues, including the brain. It is also of importance in controlling the post- prandial plasma glucose concentration. Portal venous blood leaving the absorptive area of the intestinal wall reaches the liver ﬁ rst, and consequently the hepatic cells are in a key position to buffer the hyperglycaemic effect of a high-carbohydrate meal (Fig. 12.5).
