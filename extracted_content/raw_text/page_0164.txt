The usual antihyperten- sive dose of rescinnamine is, initially, 500 Vg, 2 times a day and increase dosage grad- ually, if necessary; maintenance is 250 to 500 jig daily. Higher doses should he used cautiously because serious mental depres- sion may be increased considerably. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Moderil°. Deserpidine (canescine, recanescine) is an alkaloid obtained from the root 01 Ran- voifia canesceus L. Chemically, it is 11-des- methoxyreserpine. It is a wide-range tran- quilizer and antihvpertensive and is relatively free from the incidence and se- verity of the side effects that accompany other forms of rauwotfia therapn It is usu ally administered orally in doses of 2E0 Rg daily for mild essential hypertension and 500 jig daily for psychiatric disorders. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. flarmonyb'. Authorities are not in complete agree- ment as to the relative efficacy or safety of rauwolfia therapy as achieved by admin- istration of the powdered whole root, a total alkaloidal extract, a partial alkaloidal extract, mixture of the alkaloids, or certain individual alkaloids, in general, 100 mg daily of the standardized alkaloidal extract, or 500 jig to 1 mg of reserpine daily, is an adequate dosage. In mild or moderate hypertension, rau- wolfia or its derivatives may be the sole therapy, but in more severe hypertension, rauwolfia acts synergistically with more potent hypotensive agents. Products are available that utilize combinations of rau- wolfia or reserpine with thiazide diuretics and/or other antihvpertensive agents. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS.

(which are used in India similarly to R. SL'ricntina), R. densiflora, R. rnicrantha, R. pc,'akensis. and 2 additional unidentified species of Rauz'olfia are frequently found as adulterants. The genuine R serpent inn roots may he differentiated from roots of the other species by the absence of scie- renchvma tissue in the cortex and second- ary phloem and by the shorter and nonfi- brous fracture of its thicker pieces. Restrictions formerly placed on exports of R. scrpeittina roots from India have resulted in the use of other species, particularly for the extraction of reserpine. Root of R. tet- raphi,'lIa Linné obtained from plants grow- ing in Mexico and Guatemala is a source of the alkaloid. Catharn1hus Catharanthus or ymca is the dried whole plant of Catharanflius l'oseus a. Don (Fam. Apocynaceac), formerly designated Vinca rosea Linné. The plant is an erect, ever- blooming pubescent herb or subshrub that is wood y at the base and stands 40 to 80 cm high. It probably originated in Mada- gascar but is now cosmopolitan in the trop- ics and is widely cultivated as an orna- mental. The flowers are normally violet, rose, or white, ocellate forms are found in cultivated varieties. Botanically, it is closely related to Vinca minor Linné, the common periwirikcl (Fig. 8-19).
