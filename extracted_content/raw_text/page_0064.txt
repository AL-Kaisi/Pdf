The antineoplastic activity of these purines as well as most antimetabolites depends on the relative rates of enzy- matic activation and inactivation of these compounds in various tissues and cells. Drug resistance in certain cell lines may be caused by lower activity of activating enzymes or higher activity of catabolic enzymes.64 For the classic purine antimetabolites 6-MP major pathways of inactivation (see Scheme 10.22) include S-methylation via thiopurine-S- methyl-transferase (TPMT) and oxidation by the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO).62 Xanthine oxidase converts the drugs to the inactive thiouric acid, and inhibition of the en- zymes responsible for the catabolic breakdown of the purine drugs can potentiate the drug’s antineoplastic activity. Allopurinol is a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase and is often used as an adjuvant in purine anticancer drug therapy. Allopurinol increases both the potency and the toxicity of 6- mercaptopurine. Its main importance is that it prevents the uric acid kidney toxicity caused by the release of purines from destroyed cancer cells. Heterocyclic derivatives of 6-mercaptopurine, such as azathioprine, were designed to protect it from catabolic re- actions. Although azathioprine has antitumor activity, it is not significantly better than 6-mercaptopurine. It has an im- portant role, however, as an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplants. Adenine arabinoside (Vidarabine) con- tains the sugar, D-arabinose, which is epimeric with D-ribose at the 2�-position. This structural change makes it a compet- itive inhibitor of DNA polymerase, and this activity ac- counts for its antineoplastic activity as well as its antiviral action. Adenine arabinoside and some of its derivatives are limited in their antitumor effect by susceptibility to adeno- sine deaminase. This enzyme converts them into the inactive hypoxanthine arabinoside derivatives. High levels of adeno- sine deaminase accounts for resistance of certain tumors to the action of adenine arabinoside. The addition of fluorine to the sugar moiety has produced some purine-based drugs with resistance to the catabolic activity of adenosine deaminase. In contrast to the suscepti- bility of adenosine arabinoside to adenosine deaminase, its 2-fluoro derivative, fludarabine, is stable to this enzyme. The antineoplastic activity of fludarabine depends on its anabolic conversion to the corresponding triphosphate. 2-Chloro-2�-deoxyadenosine (cladribine) also is resistant to adenosine deaminase. It is phosphorylated in cells to the triphosphate by cytidine kinase, and the triphosphate in- hibits enzymes required for DNA repair. Folates Folic acid and the structures of the major antifolate anti- cancer drugs are shown in Figure 10.10. Methotrexate is the classic antimetabolite of folic acid structurally derived by N- methylation of the para-aminobenzoic acid residue (PABA) and replacement of a pteridine hydroxyl by the bioisosteric amino group. The conversion of MOH to MNH2 increases the basicity of N-3 and yields greater enzyme affinity. This drug competitively inhibits the binding of the substrate folic acid to the enzyme DHFR, resulting in reductions in the syn- thesis of nucleic acid bases, perhaps most importantly, the conversion of uridylate to thymidylate as catalyzed by thymidylate synthetase.65 In addition, purine synthesis is in- hibited because the N-10-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid is a formyl donor involved in purine synthesis. The interconver- sion of the various folate species is shown in Scheme 10.23. Recall that in Scheme 10.16, THFs are cofactors in at least two key steps in the normal biosynthesis of purines. Methotrexate66 is a broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent commonly used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia and other lymphomas and sarcomas. The major side effects seen are bone marrow suppression, pulmonary fibrosis, and GI ulceration. Leucovorin is often given 6 to 24 hours after methotrexate to prevent the long- term effects on normal cells by preventing the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Related to this is Pemetrexed, but its scope is greater in that it not only inhibits DHFR but also TS and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), which is involved in purine biosynthesis (see Fig. 10.16). The material is taken into tumor cells by the reduced folate- carrier systems and subsequently converted to the polyglu- tamate, which is retained in the cell.
