Stramonjurn seed contains about 0,4 of alkaloids, principally hyoscyamine with a small proportion of scopolamine and traces of atropine. Stramonium is generally regarded as a noxious weed and has frequently caused poisoning in children when seeds were in- gested. The chief toxic symptoms are those of atropine poisoning: dilated pupils, ii- paired vision, dryness of the skin and se- cretions, extreme thirst, hallucinations. and loss of consciousness. Although news- paper items often describe the Circumstan- ces, such cases are also reported in the medical literature. Because the plant is rather widespread, pharmacists may he asked to help in identif ying the plant and in applying emergency measures pending arrival of a physician. Other Solanaceous Drugs Withanja is the dried root of Wifhanin (mznlJcra Dunal (Fain. Solanaceae), a plant [hat grows within a broad range from southern Europe to India, and in Africa. It is cultivated in India, where it has been employed as a sedative since antiquity. Studies have shown that withania, which is closel y related botanically to bel- ladonna and hvuscyamus, Contains about a dozen biochemically heterogeneous al- kaloids. Tropine and pseudotropine are ac- companied by hvgrine (pyrrolidine deriv- ative), isopelletierine (piperidine derivative), cuscohvgrine (2 pyrrolidine moieties), anaferine (2 piperidine moie- ties), and anahvgrine (1 pvrrolidine moiety and I piperidine moiety), The principle re- sponsible for the sedative action of the drug has not yet been determined, but the stud y of the alkaloids of this drug has ad- vanced our knowledge of the chemical-tax- onomic relationships of solanaceous plants. Duhojsja consists of the dried leaves of
