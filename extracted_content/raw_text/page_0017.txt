emphasized previously, the drug will go through a series of partitioning steps: (a) leaving the aqueous extracellular flu- ids, (b) passing through lipid membranes, and (c) entering other aqueous environments before reaching the receptor (Fig. 2.1). In this sense, a drug is undergoing the same par- titioning phenomenon that happens to any chemical in a sep- aratory funnel containing water and a nonpolar solvent such as hexane, chloroform, or ether. The partition coefficient (P) is the ratio of the molar concentration of chemical in the nonaqueous phase (usually 1-octanol) versus that in the aqueous phase (Eq. 2.10). For reasons already discussed, it is more common to use the logarithmic expression (Eq. 2.11). The difference between the separatory funnel model and what actually occurs in the body is that the partitioning in the funnel will reach an equilibrium at which the rate of chemical leaving the aqueous phase and entering the organic phase will equal the rate of the chemical moving from the organic phase to the aqueous phase. This is not the physio- logical situation. Refer to Figure 2.1 and note that dynamic changes are occurring to the drug, such as it being metabo- lized, bound to serum albumin, excreted from the body, and bound to receptors. The environment for the drug is not static. Upon administration, the drug will be pushed through the membranes because of the high concentration of drug in the extracellular fluids relative to the concentration in the intracellular compartments. In an attempt to maintain equi- librium ratios, the flow of the drug will be from systemic circulation through the membranes onto the receptors. As the drug is metabolized and excreted from the body, it will be pulled back across the membranes, and the concentration of drug at the receptors will decrease. P � (Eq. 2.10) log P � log( ) (Eq. 2.11) Equations 2.10 and 2.11 assume that the drug is in the non- polar state. A large percentage of drugs are amines whose pKa is such that at physiological pH 7.4, a significant percentage of the drug will be in its protonated, ionized form. A similar statement can be made for the HA acids (carboxyl, sulfon- amide, imide) in that at physiological pH, a significant [solute]oct [solute]aq [chemical]oct [chemical]aq percentage will be in their anionic forms. An assumption is made that the ionic form is water-soluble and will remain in the water phase of an octanol/water system. This reality has led to the use of log D, which is defined as the equilibrium ratio of both the ionized and un-ionized species of the mole- cule in an octanol/water system (Eq. 2.12). The percent ion- ization of ionized HA acids and BH protonated amines and acids can be estimated from Equations 2.3 and 2.4 and the log D from Equations 2.13 and 2.14, respectively. log D � log( ) (Eq. 2.12) log Dacids � log P � log[ ] (Eq. 2.13) log Dbases � log P � log[ ] (Eq. 2.14) Because much of the time the drug’s movement across membranes is a partitioning process, the partition coef- ficient has become the most common physicochemical property. The question that now must be asked is what immiscible nonpolar solvent system best mimics the water/lipid membrane barriers found in the body? It is now realized that the n-octanol/water system is an excellent esti- mator of drug partitioning in biological systems. One could argue that it was fortuitous that n-octanol was available in reasonable purity for the early partition coefficient determi- nations. To appreciate why this is so, one must understand the chemical nature of the lipid membranes. These membranes are not exclusively anhydrous fatty or oily structures. As a first approximation, they can be consid- ered bilayers composed of lipids consisting of a polar cap and large hydrophobic tail. Phosphoglycerides are major components of lipid bilayers (Fig. 2.10). Other groups of bi- functional lipids include the sphingomyelins, galactocere- brosides, and plasmalogens. The hydrophobic portion is composed largely of unsaturated fatty acids, mostly with cis double bonds. In addition, there are considerable amounts of cholesterol esters, protein, and charged mucopolysaccha- rides in the lipid membranes. The final result is that these membranes are highly organized structures composed of channels for transport of important molecules such as metabolites, chemical regulators (hormones), amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids into the cell and removal of waste products and biochemically produced products out of the 1 (1 � 10(pKa�pH)) 1 (1 � 10(pH�pKa)) [solute]oct [solute]aq ionized � [solute]aq nonionized Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 19 Figure 2.9 Plot of log 1/BR versus log PC.
