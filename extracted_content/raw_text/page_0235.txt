FIGURE 12–2 Mechanism of action of nitrates, nitrites, and other substances that increase the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in vascular smooth muscle cells. Steps leading to relaxation are shown with blue arrows. MLCK*, activated myosin light­chain kinase (see Figure 12–1). Nitrosothiols (SNOs) appear to have non­cGMP­dependent effects on potassium channels and Ca2+­ATPase. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; GC*, activated guanylyl cyclase; mtALDH2, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase­2; PDE, phosphodiesterase; ROCK, Rho kinase.
