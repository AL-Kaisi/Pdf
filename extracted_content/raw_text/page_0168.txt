ALKAlOIDSï¿½ 229 Fig. 8-20. Nux Vomica: orbicular, ciiinpressed, concavo-con c, inictln ie, irregular-lv bent, margin acute or rounded, 10 to 30 mm in diameter, 3 to 5 mm in thickness, externally grayish yellow or grayish green, covered with appressed hairs giving the seed a satiny luster, sometimes with adhering dark brown fragments of the fruit pulp; hilum, near the center of one side and a ionic or lets distinct ridge resembling a rophe extending from it to the micropvlo; very hard when dry, tough when damp; Internally whitish, horny; endosperm in two more or less regular olneavo-convex halves; embryo small, situated near the micropyle, and with two heart-shaped cotyledons; inodorous; taste intensely and persistently bitter. The two halves of the seed at the middle of the bottom row show the two cetyloduns and the caulk-he of the embryo lying against the endosperm. geneserine, and physovenine. I'hysostig- mine is the major alkaloid and is present in the cotyledons to the extent of 0.04 to 0.3%. Physostigmine or eserine is an alkaloid usually obtained from the dried, ripe seed of P. venenosum. It occurs as a white, odor- less, microcrystalline powder that may ac- quire a red tint when exposed to heat, light, air, or contact with traces of metals. Therefore, physostigmine should he pre- served in tight, light-resistant containers in quantities not exceeding 1 g. USE. Physostigmine is a reversible inhib- itor of the cholinesterases and thus en- hances the effects of endogenous acetyl- choline. In the eye, increase in cholinergic activity leads to miosis, contraction of the ciliary muscle, and a decrease in intraocu- lar pressure caused by an increased out- flow of the aqueous humor. Physostigmine is employed in ophthalmology to treat glaucoma. Physostigmine salicylate or eserine sali- cylate is the salicylate of the alkaloid, phy- sostigmine. It is a white powder that also acquires a red tint when exposed to the conditions described under physostig-
