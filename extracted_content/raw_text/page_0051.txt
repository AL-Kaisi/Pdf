PROCARBAZINE, DACARBAZINE, AND TEMOZOLOMIDE Procarbazine is an antineoplastic agent that was originally developed as a result of efforts to find new inhibitors of monoamine oxidase. Subsequent screening revealed anti- neoplastic activity.35 It was initially believed that the cyto- toxicity was related to the ability of the compound to undergo auto-oxidation to give hydrogen peroxide, which in the presence of Fe�2 would produce hydroxide radicals ca- pable of cleaving DNA.36,37 Subsequent work showed that although this did occur, sufficient amounts of hydrogen peroxide were not produced to account for the observed effects. Metabolism studies revealed that oxidation of procarbazine does occur in the liver and is mediated by CYP and monoamine oxidase to give azo-procarbazine. This compound may also be generated nonenzymatically in an aerobic environment (Scheme 10.13).38–40 There are several chemical and metabolic pathways that azo-procarbazine may then undergo, and there is some disagreement regard- ing the exact structure of the active alkylating species. One such route involves CYP-mediated oxidation of the benzylic methylene carbon with subsequent decomposition to give methyldiazine and the aldehyde. The methyldiazine may then decompose by homolytic bond cleavage to give methyl and hydrogen radicals along with nitrogen gas or be further oxidized to give the diazo compound, which can decompose to give the methyl carbocation. Methyldiazine may also be produced by a minor route involving isomerization of azo-procarbazine to give the hydrazone, which subsequently undergoes hydrolysis to give the aldehyde and methylhy- drazine. Methylhydrazine may react with oxygen to give methyldiazine, which then decomposes as before. Studies utilizing radiolabeled procarbazine indicated that the termi- nal methyl group was found covalently bound to the N-7 position of guanine especially on tRNA disrupting its func- tion and preventing protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis.41 There was also a small amount of methylation at the O-6 po- sition of guanine.42 Hydrazines are also capable of inhibit- ing monoamine oxidase as seen with isocarboxazid and phenelzine; however, procarbazine is only a weak inhibitor of this enzyme. The agent is also capable of inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase and producing a disulfiram-like reaction. Given the involvement of the CYP system in its activation, the action of procarbazine is subject to drug in- teractions with both inducers and inhibitors of this system. Somewhat related is dacarbazine, which was initially thought to act as an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, but lat- ter was shown to be an alkylating agent.43 Activation of the agent occurs through the action of CYP (isozymes 1A1, 1A2, and 2E1) to give the demethylated product monomethyl tri- azeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC) (Scheme 10.14).44 Tautomerization allows for decomposition to give the amino- carboxamido-imidazole and diazomethane, which is capable of alkylating DNA.45 An alternative pathway involves acid catalyzed or photoinduced loss of dimethylamine to give an alternative diazo compound (diazo-IC), which may not only 366 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 10.6 Nitrosoureas antineoplastics.
