During the product development stages of a proposed drug product, pharmaceutical manufacturers employ bio­ availability studies to compare different formulations of the drug substance to ascertain which one allows the most desir­ able absorption pattern. Later bioavailability studies may be used to compare the availability of the drug substance in different production batches. They may also be used to com­ pare the availability of the drug substance in different dosage forms (e.g., tablets, capsules, elixirs) or in the same dosage form produced by different ( competing) manufacturers. According to the FDA (5), the in vivo bioavailability of a drug product may be determined by measurements of the concentration of the active drug ingredient, its thera­ peutic moiety, or its metabolite( s) in the blood or urine or by pharmacological effects. For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bioavail­ ability may be assessed by measurements of the rate and extent to which the active drug moiety becomes available at the site of action. Two drug products may be considered bioequivalent if their rates and extents of absorption do not show a significant difference when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions, either single dose or multiple dose. Single-Dose and Multiple-Dose Bioavailability Studies Single-dose bioavailability studies compare the drug prod­ uct to be tested against the appropriate reference material. Studies are conducted in normal adults generally in the fast­ ing state. A single-dose study is usually crossover in design, unless a parallel design or other design is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons ( refer to Fig. 2. 7 for study designs). The sampling time for blood and/or urine is usually at least three times the half-life of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, its metabolite(s), or at least three times the half-life of the acute pharmacological effect. Measured are the peak concentration in the blood and the total area under the curve (discussed later in this chapter). Multiple-dose bioavailability studies compare the test product and the reference material after repeated admin­ istration to determine steady-state levels of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety in the body. Studies are conducted in human subjects in the fasting or nonfasting state, depending upon the conditions reflected in the pro­ posed labeling of the test product. A multiple-dose study may be required for a test prod­ uct if (a) there is a difference in the rate of absorption but not in the extent of absorption; (b) there is excessive variability in bioavailability from subject to subject; (c) the concentration of the active drug ingredient or thera­ peutic moiety, or its metabolites, in the blood resulting from a single dose is too low for accurate determination by the analytical method; or (d) the drug product is an extended-release dosage form. A multiple-dose study is generally crossover in design unless scientific reasons dic­ tate otherwise ( e.g., if the study is designed to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of a new drug product, a new drug delivery system, or an extended-release dosage form). At least five times the half-life of the active drug ingredient, its therapeutic moiety or its active metabolite(s) is measured in the blood or urine. FDA Bioavailability Submission Requirements The FDA requires bioavailability data submissions in the following instances (5): l. New Drug Applications (NDAs): A section of each NDA is required to describe the human pharmacoki­ netic data and human bioavailability data, or infor­ mation supporting a waiver of the bioavailability data requirement (see waiver provisions following).
