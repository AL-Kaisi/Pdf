problems and discomfort as a result of pH extremes. Phenytoin (HA acid; pKa 8.3) injection must be adjusted to pH 12 with sodium hydroxide to ensure complete ionization and maximize water solubility. In theory, a pH of 10.3 will result in 99.0% of the drug being an anionic water-soluble conjugate base. To lower the concentration of phenytoin in the insoluble acid form even further and maintain excess al- kalinity, the pH is raised to 12 to obtain 99.98% of the drug in the ionized form. Even then, a cosolvent system of 40% propylene glycol, 10% ethyl alcohol, and 50% water for injection is used to ensure complete solution. This highly al- kaline solution is irritating to the patient and generally can- not be administered as an admixture with other intravenous fluids that are buffered more closely at physiological pH 7.4. This decrease in pH would result in the parent un- ionized phenytoin precipitating out of solution. Tropicamide is an anticholinergic drug administered as eye drops for its mydriatic response during eye examina- tions. With a pKa of 5.2, the drug has to be buffered near pH 4 to obtain more than 90% ionization. The acidic eye drops can sting. Some optometrists and ophthalmologists use local anesthetic eye drops to minimize the patient’s discomfort. The only atom with a meaningful pKa is the pyridine nitrogen. The amide nitrogen has no acid–base properties in aqueous media. Adjustments in pH to maintain water solubility can sometimes lead to chemical stability problems. An example is indomethacin (HA acid; pKa 4.5), which is unstable in al- kaline media. Therefore, the preferred oral liquid dosage form is a suspension buffered at pH 4 to 5. Because this is near the drug’s pKa, only 50% will be in the water-soluble form. There is a medical indication requiring intravenous administration of indomethacin to premature infants. The intravenous dosage form is the lyophilized (freeze-dried) sodium salt, which is reconstituted just prior to use. Drug Distribution and pKa The pKa can have a pronounced effect on the pharmacoki- netics of the drug. As discussed previously, drugs are trans- ported in the aqueous environment of the blood. Those drugs in an ionized form will tend to distribute throughout the body more rapidly than will un-ionized (nonpolar) mol- ecules. With few exceptions, the drug must leave the polar environment of the plasma to reach the site of action. In gen- eral, drugs pass through the nonpolar membranes of capil- lary walls, cell membranes, and the blood-brain barrier in the un-ionized (nonpolar) form. For HA acids, it is the par- ent acid that will readily cross these membranes (Fig. 2.5). The situation is just the opposite for the BH� acids. The un- ionized conjugate base (free amine) is the species most read- ily crossing the nonpolar membranes (Fig. 2.6). Consider the changing pH environment experienced by the drug molecule orally administered. The drug first en- counters the acidic stomach, where the pH can range from 2 to 6 depending on the presence of food. HA acids with pKa’s of 4 to 5 will tend to be nonionic and be absorbed partially through the gastric mucosa. (The main reason most acidic drugs are absorbed from the intestinal tract rather than the stomach is that the microvilli of the intestinal mucosa pro- vide a large surface area relative to that found in the gastric mucosa of the stomach.) In contrast, amines (pKa 9–10) will be protonated (BH� acids) in the acidic stomach and usually will not be absorbed until reaching the mildly alkaline intes- tinal tract (pH 8). Even here, only a portion of the amine- containing drugs will be in their nonpolar conjugate base form (Fig. 2.4). Remember that the reactions shown in Figures 2.3 and 2.4 are equilibrium reactions with Ka values. Therefore, whenever the nonpolar form of either an HA acid (as the acid) or a B base (the conjugate base of the BH� acid) passes the lipid barrier, the ratio of conjugate base to acid (percent ionization) will be maintained. Based on Equations 2.3 and 2.4, this ratio depends on the pKa (a con- stant) and the pH of the medium. For example, once in systemic circulation, the plasma pH of 7.4 will be one of the determinants of whether the drug will tend to remain in the aqueous environment of the blood or partition across lipid membranes into hepatic tissue to be metabolized, into the kidney for excretion, into tissue depots, or to the receptor tissue. A useful exercise is to calculate either the [conjugate base]/[acid] ratio using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Eq. 2.2) or percent 16 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry TABLE 2.4 Percentage Ionization Relative to the pKa Ionization (%) HA Acids BH Acids pKa � 2 pH units 0.99 99.0 pKa � 1 pH unit 9.1 90.9 pKa � pH 50.0 50.0 pKa � 1 pH unit 90.9 9.1 pKa � 2 pH units 99.0 0.99 Figure 2.5 Passage of HA acids through lipid barriers.
