The first question in management is how urgent it is to treat the hypertension. Cardiovascular risk factors in this man include family history of early coronary disease and elevated cholesterol. Evidence of end­organ impact includes left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram. The strong family history suggests that this patient has essential hypertension. However, the patient should undergo the usual screening tests including renal function, thyroid function, and serum electrolyte measurements. An echocardiogram should also be considered to determine whether the patient has left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to valvular or other structural heart disease as opposed to hypertension. Initial management in this patient can be behavioral, including dietary changes and aerobic exercise. However, most patients like this will require medication. Thiazide diuretics in low doses are inexpensive, have relatively few side effects, and are effective in many patients with mild hypertension. Other first­line agents include angiotensin­converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Beta blockers might be considered if the patient had coronary disease or had labile hypertension. Either single agent or a combination of two agents in low doses should be prescribed and the patient reassessed in a month. If additional agents are needed, one should be a thiazide diuretic. Once blood pressure is controlled, patients should be followed periodically to reinforce the need for compliance with both lifestyle changes and medications.
