216ï¿½ ALKALOIDS Fig. 8-14. Poppy capsules showing the milky juice exuding from transverse incisions and lorniing irregular globular masses on the surface. The hardened milky juice forms opium. been obtained from opium and its extracts, some of which are alteration products of the alkaloids occurring naturally in the drug. The most important of these are mor- phine, which exists to the extent of 4 to 21%; codeine, 0.8 to 2.5%; noscapine (for- merly narcotine), 4 to 8%; papaverine 0.5 to 2.5%; and thebaine, 0.5 to 2%. Other alkaloids include narceine, protopine lau- danine, codamine, cryptopifle, 1anthopme, and neconidine. Opium also contains from 3 to 5% of me- conic acid, which exists free or in combi- nation with morphine codeine, and other alkaloids. It forms rhombic prisms that are soluble in water and alcohol and give a red color in solutions of ferric chloride. The color is not altered when diluted hydro- chloric acid is added. Because meconic acid is found only in opium this test may be used for the detection of opium. The total ash yield of opium is from 4 to 8%, with about 0.55% of acid-insoluble ash. Opium in its normal, air-dried condition yields not less than 9.5% of anhydrous morphine. USES AND DOSE Opium is a pharmaccutic necessity for powdered opium. it acts chiefly on the central nervous system; its action first stimulates and then depresses nerve response. It serves as an analgesic, a hypnotic and a narcotic and checks ex- cessive peristalsis and contracts the pupil of the eve. A dose of 60 mg was formerly listed for opium and powdered opium. ADULTERANTS. Fragments of the cap- sules, the pulp of figs and other fruits, trag- acanth, beeswax, powdered cumin seed, starch, and such inorganic substances as clay, sand, stone, lead piping, and lead bullets have been found in opium. Powdered opium yields not less than 10% and not more than 10.5% of anhy- drous morphine- Powdered opium of a higher percentage morphine may be re- duced to the official standard by admixture with powdered opium of a lower percent- age or with any of the diluents, except starch, permitted for powdered extracts.
