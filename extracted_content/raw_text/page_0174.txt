Ergotamine tartrate occurs as colorless crystals or as a white, crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in water or in alcohol. Ergotamine possesses oxytocic properties, but it is not employed for that effect. It is categorized as a specific analgesic in treat- ment of migraine Ergotamine reduces ex- tracranjal blood flow and decreases the am- plitude of pulsations in the cranial arteries that have been associated with migraine. It may inhibit receptor uptake of norepi- nephrirte at sympathetic nerve endings, in- creasing the vasoconsirictive action. The usual dose is, sublingually, 2 mg, then 2 mg every 30 minutes, if necessary, to a total of 6 mg per 24 h; do not exceed 10 mg per week. The patient should be advised to ini- tiate therapy at onset of the attack and to lie down in a quiet and darkened room for 2 hours after taking the medication. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS.
