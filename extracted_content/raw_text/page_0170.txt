ALKALOIDSï¿½ 231 ted from the official compendia. Neverthe- less, its alkaloids continue to enjoy widespread use as extremely important medicinal agents it therefore appears worthwhile to redefine, in light of modern knowledge, the source of these active com- pounds. At present, ergot alkaloids are obtained on a commercial scale from both parasitic and saprophytic sources. The former is the dried scierotium of C. purpurea developed on rye plants. Some alkaloids are also ob- tained from the fermentation broth in which the mycelium of selected strains of Claoiceps paspali Stevens & Hall has been grown saprophytically in submerged cul- ture. The qualitative and quantitative com- position of the alkaloids obtained from either source is influenced by a number of factors, but especially by the identity of the strain (chemical race) of organism in- volved. At present, both peptide alkaloids and noripeptide (water-soluble) alkaloids are obtained from parasitically developed ergot scleroha. Only the latter type is pro- duced commercially in saprophytic cul- ture. However, lysergic acid produced by fermentation is converted on a commercial scale to the peptide alkaloid, ergotamine, by chemical semisynthesis. In the absence of official standards, the word, ergot, ma y be used in a variety of ways to describe either one or more species of Ctaviceps, the mycelium produced by these species in saprophytic culture, or the resting body (sclerotium) of the fungus produced parasitically on rye plants. When the crude drug ergot is referred to in this hook, it designates the latter product. Some knowledge of the rather complex life cycle of the ergot fungus is required to understand the different methods of pro- duction of the alkaloids. In nature, the or- ganism is parasitic. In the spring, one of its spores comes into contact with the ovary of a grass, frequently rye, where it ger- minates, forming hyphal strands that pen- etrate into the host tissue. The hyphae eventually form a mass of tissue known as a mycelium, which supplants the ovary. Some of the hyphal strands produce asex- ual spores, known as conidiospores, which become suspended in a viscous, sugary liq- uid, known as honeydew. Honeydew is se- creted by the mycelium. Insects are at- tracted to this honeydew and carry it and the spores to other host plants, where the process is repeated. This stage of devel- opment of the organism is termed the asexual or sphacelial stage. In the second stage of development, the mycelium eventually replaces the entire ovary, then gradually hardens, becomes dark purple, and forms a resting body, known as a scierotium (Fig. 8-22). The sc]erotiuni, in turn, normally falls to the ground, overwinters, and, in the spring, produces sexual spores or ascospores that repeat the entire cycle. This second phase of development of the organism is referred to as the sexual or ascigerous stage. When ergot spores are germinated in a suitable nutrient medium in the laboratory (saprophytic growth), hyphae are formed. The hyphae produce mycelium and conid- iospores, but no further development oc- curs. Because the medicinally useful alka- loids are normally produced only during the latter stages of parasitic scierotial de- velopment, the difficulties in producing them in saprophytic rnycelial culture are apparent. Before the introduction of modern agri- cultural practices, the fungus periodically invaded rye fields in Russia and in other European countries, and the ergot scierotia were harvested with the rye grains. Rye flour made from the contaminated rye grains was subsequently made into rye bread and ingested. Thus the fungus was responsible for severe outbreaks of a dis- ease, both in humans and in cattle, which is today known as ergotism. Two distinct types are recognized. One, common in parts of France, was characterized by the appearance of gangrene in the extremities. The gangrene was caused by the restricted
