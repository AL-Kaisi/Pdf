AtKALOIOS ï¿½ 213 Fig. 8-13. Signrus il,nlrnis showing (left) seed pod and characteristic leaf and (right) show\ white Hower oline derivatives. Species of the families Ranunculaceae, I3erberidaceae, Menisper- maceae, and Papaveraceae contain alka- loids of this type. Sanguinaria of good quality contains not more than 5% of the roots of the plant. Shriveled rhizomes that are gray and free from starch should be rejected. USES AND DOSE. Sanguinaria has stimu- lating expectorant and emetic properties. The usual dose is 125 rug. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Prunicodeinet. Tubocurarine Chloride Curare or South American arrow poison is a crude dried extract from the bark and stems of Strt,cl-inos castelnaci Weddell, S tex- ifera Bentham, S. crevauxii C. Planchon (Fam. Loganiaceae) and from Chundodcn- dron fo,nentosurn Ruiz et Pavon (Fam. Men- ispermaceae). The term "curare" is derived from woorari or urari, Indian words for poi- son. Curare va.ries in composition among the Indian tribes. Each tribe modifies the formula in accordance with tribal custom. The young bark is scraped tiff the plants, mixed with other substances, and boiled in water and strained or extracted by crude percolation with water. It is evaporated to a paste over a fire or in the sun. The earliest available preparations were named accord- ing to the containers in which the drug was packaged: calabah (gourd), tube (bam- boo), or pot (clay pot) curare. Curare is obtained from the Orinoco basin, the upper Amazon regions, and the eastern Ecuadorian plateau. It is a brownish or black, shiny, resinoid mass with a bitter taste. It is readily soluble in cold water and in dilute alcohol. Any given sample of the drug contains at least several of a large possible number of alkaloids and quaternary compounds, but the specific composition varies accord- ing to the identity of the plant material from which it was prepared. (-i-)-Tuhocu- rarine, the most important constituent, is a quaternary compound that Contains a bis- benzylisoquinoline structure. The crude extract exhibits a paralyzing effect on untary muscle (curariform effect) by block- ing nerve impulses to skeletal muscles at the myoneural junction. It also produces a toxic action on blood vessels as well as a histaminelike effect. Curare was brought to England by Sir Waiter Raleigh in 1595, but it has only re- cently come into prominence in medical circles. Claude Bernard, Kolliker, Langley, and other investigators studied the effect
