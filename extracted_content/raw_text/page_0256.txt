channels in vessels and heart others with other cardiac depressants and hypotensive drugs • Nifedipine (a dihydropyridine) Block of vascular L­ type calcium channels > cardiac channels Like verapamil and diltiazem; less cardiac effect Prophylaxis of angina and treatment of hypertension but prompt release nifedipine is contraindicated Oral, duration 4–6 h • Toxicity: Excessive hypotension, baroreceptor reflex tachycardia • Interactions: Additive with other vasodilators • Amlodipine, felodipine, other dihydropyridines: Like nifedipine but slower onset and longer duration (up to 12 h or more) MISCELLANEOUS • Ranolazine Inhibits late sodium current in heart • also may modify fatty acid oxidation at much higher doses Reduces cardiac oxygen demand • fatty acid oxidation modification could improve efficiency of cardiac oxygen utilization Prophylaxis of angina Oral, duration 6–8 h • Toxicity: QT interval prolongation (but no increase of torsades de pointes), nausea, constipation, dizziness • Interactions: Inhibitors of CYP3A increase ranolazine concentration and duration of action • Ivabradine: Inhibitor of sinoatrial pacemaker; reduction of heart rate reduces oxygen demand • Trimetazidine, allopurinol, perhexiline, fasudil: See text PREPARATIONS AVAILABLE GENERIC NAME AVAILABLE AS NITRATES & NITRITES Amyl nitrite Generic Isosorbide dinitrate (oral, oral sustained release, sublingual) Generic, Isordil Isosorbide mononitrate Ismo, others Nitroglycerin (sublingual, buccal, oral sustained release, parenteral, transdermal patch, topical ointment) Generic, others CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS
