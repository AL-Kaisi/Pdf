vomiting, pain at the injection site, impotence, sterility, amenorrhea, and infertility. Hepatotoxicity may initially present as elevations in serum transaminase levels. There is also an increased risk of secondary cancers as is often seen with the alkylating agents. LOMUSTINE (CHLOROETHYL-CYCLOHEXYL- NITROSOUREA, CCNU, CEENU) Lomustine is available in 10-, 40-, and 100-mg capsules for oral administration in the treatment of primary and metasta- tic brain cancers and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This lipophilic agent is well absorbed, widely distributed, and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Lomustine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, which is mediated by CYP3A4 to give several hydroxylated metabolites, which arise as a result of oxida- tion of the cyclohexyl ring. Several of these are more active than the parent compound. Denitrosation and dechlorination have also been demonstrated to occur for lomustine as well. The intact drug was not found in plasma when the agent was administered orally. Elimination occurs primarily in the urine with an elimination half-life of 16 to 72 hours. Myelosuppression is dose limiting and presents in a manner similar to that seen with carmustine. Other toxicities include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, impotence, sterility, amenor- rhea, and infertility. Pulmonary and renal toxicity are rarely seen during standard-dose therapy but increase during high- dose therapy. STREPTOZOCIN (STREPTOZOTOCIN, STZ, ZANOSAR) Streptozocin is available in 1-g vials for IV administration in the treatment of metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pan- creas, colon cancer, and Hodgkin’s disease. Activation re- sults in the formation of methyl carbonium ions, which alky- late DNA, but the agent is less effective in alkylating DNA and carbamylating proteins than other nitrosoureas, which is because in part of an intramolecular carbamoylation. The in- ternal carbamate group migration occurs via the hydroxyl groups of the glucose portion of the molecule. There is a re- duced effect on RNA function compared with other ni- trosoureas as well. The hydrophilic agent is rapidly cleared from the plasma with an elimination half-life of 35 minutes. The presence of the glucose moiety allows for utilization of glucose transporters, which concentrate the compound in the �-cells of the pancreas. The metabolism of the agent has not been well characterized. Renal toxicity is dose limiting and may present initially as proteinuria and azotemia but may progress to renal failure. Nausea and vomiting may be severe with the agent, whereas myelosuppression is gener- ally mild. Normal glucose metabolism may be altered so that hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may be seen. In some animal species, streptozocin produces diabetes but much milder effects are seen in man. PROCARBAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (PCZ, PCB, MATULANE) Procarbazine is available in 50-mg tablets for oral admin- istration in the treatment of Hodgkin’s (part of MOPP) and non-Hodgkin’s disease, brain cancer, and mycosis fun- goides. The major mechanisms of resistance appear to be enhanced activity of DNA-repair enzymes including en- hanced O-6-alkylguanine DNA transferase (AGAT), which removes the methyl group from the O-6 of guanine. The agent is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral ad- ministration and extensively metabolized in the liver to give azo-procarbazine followed by further oxidation to methyldiazine and the aldehyde. The parent drug and metabolites cross the blood-brain barrier. Elimination oc- curs in the urine mostly as metabolites with an elimination half-life of 1 hour. Myelosuppression is dose limiting, gen- erally presenting as thrombocytopenia that may be fol- lowed by leucopenia. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient patients may develop hemolytic anemia during procarbazine therapy. Other adverse effects include nau- sea, vomiting, hypersensitivity, flulike symptoms, amenor- rhea, and azoospermia. Central nervous symptom effects may be seen, including lethargy, confusion, neuropathies, and seizure. DACARBAZINE (DTIC, DTIC-DOME) Dacarbazine is available in 100- and 200-mg vials for IV administration in the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease, ma- lignant melanoma, carcinoid cancer, neuroblastoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. Resistance to dacarbazine has been pri- marily attributed to enhanced activity of AGAT. The vol- ume of distribution exceeds the amount of water in the body suggesting the compound distributes into body tissues possibly the liver. The agent is not highly protein bound (20%) and is metabolized in the liver by CYP to give MTIC and 4-amino-5-imidazole-carboxamide (AIC). The demethylation reaction is mediated by isozymes CYP1A1/2 and CYP2E1. Elimination occurs via the urine with 40% to 50% occurring as unchanged drug. Dose-limiting myelo- suppression presents as both leucopenia and thrombocy- topenia. Other adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, flulike symptoms, photosensitivity, and pain at the injec- tion site. ALTRETAMINE (HMM, HEXALEN, HEXAMETHYLMELAMINE) Altretamine (Fig. 10.7) is available in 50-mg capsules for oral administration as a second-line treatment for ovarian cancer. The mechanism of action has not been firmly established, al- though the spectrum of activity is similar to that for other alkylating agents; however, cross-resistance is not seen. Cytotoxicity has been correlated with metabolism to give the carbinolamines, which may form imines capable of cross- linking, or decompose to give formaldehyde, which may react with nucleophiles on DNA or proteins. The agent is well ab- sorbed upon oral administration, well distributed, and highly (90%) plasma protein bound. The agent is extensively metab- olized in the liver by CYP to give demethylated metabolites Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 371 Figure 10.7 Chemical structure of altretamine.
