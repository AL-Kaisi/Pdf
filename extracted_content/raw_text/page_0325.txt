Most drugs administered orally can be adequately described using a one-compartment model, whereas drugs administered by rapid intravenous infusion are usually best described by a two-compartment or three­ compartment model system. Assuming that a drug's volume of distribution is con­ stant within this system, the total amount of drug in the body (Qb) can be calculated from the following equation: Qb = [ c�] [Vd ] Equation 5.4 Usually, C� is determined by extrapolating the drug con­ centration-time plot to time zero. In this simple one-compartment system, it is assumed that the administered drug is confined to the plasma ( or blood) and then excreted. Drugs that exhibit this behavior have small volumes of distribution. For example, a drug such as warfarin sodium, which is extensively bound to plasma albumin, will have a volume of distribution equivalent to that of plasma water, about 2.8 L in an average 70-kg adult. Some drugs, however, are initially distributed at somewhat different rates in various fluids and tissues. Consequently, these drugs' kinetic behavior can best be illustrated by considering an expansion of the one-compartment system to the two-compartment model (Fig. 5.15). Drug l Central compartment Where: Peripheral compartment Qc = Quantity of drug in central compartment Ve = Volume of the central compartment QP = Quantity of drug in peripheral compartment VP = Volume of the peripheral compartment FIGURE 5.15. A two-compartment system. In the two-compartment system, a drug enters into and is instantaneously distributed throughout the central compartment. Its subsequent distribution into the second or peripheral compartment is slower. For simplicity, on the basis of blood perfusion and tissue-plasma partition coefficients for a given drug, various tissues and organs are considered together and designated either central com­ partment or peripheral compartment. The central com­ partment is usually considered to include the blood, the extracellular space, and organs with good blood perfusion, such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. The peripheral compartment usually comprises tissues and organs that are poorly perfused by blood, such as the skin, bone, and fat.
