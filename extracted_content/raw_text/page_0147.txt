208� ALKALOIDS powder that is odorless and has a bitter taste. It is available in sustained release tab- lets. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. QuinagIute, Duraquirt®. Quinidine polygalacturoflate a fforcIs controlled and more uniform absorption through the intestinal mucosa than does quinidirie sulfate. In addition, it produces a lower incidence of gastrointestinal irri- tation. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Cardioquin®. Quinine is the diastereoisoj'ner of quin- idine. It occurs as white, odorless, bulky, bitter crystals or as a crystalline powder. It darkens when exposed to light and efflo- resces in dry air. It is freely soluble in al- cohol, ether, and chloroform but slightly soluble in water. H Quinine Quinine sulfate is the sulfate of an al- kaloid obtained from the bark of Cinchona species. It occurs as white, odorless, bitter, fine, needlelike crystals that are usually lusterless. It becomes brownish when ex- posed to light. It is not readily soluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, or ether. The drug is an antimalarial and once was the only agent available to treat this dis- ease, which afflicts millions of people worldwide. Quinine's antimalarial action is believed to be the intercalation of the quin- oline moiety into the DNA of the Plasmo- dium parasite, thereby reducing the effec- tiveness of DNA to act as a template. Intercalating agents such as quinine are rigid planar polycyclic molecules that in- sert between the adjacent stacked base pairs of the double helix of DNA. This re- suits in DNA that has increased length, and because of a greater electrostatic in- teraction between the intercalated mole- cule and the two DNA strands, there is an inhibition of the strand separation that is required for replication and transcription of the genetic code. it suppresses but does not cure vivax malaria and was once almost abandoned in this country, in favor of chlo- roquine or other newer, synthetic anti- malarials. Recently, it has regained consid- erable importance in the treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in combination with pyrimethamine and sul- fadiazine or tetracycline. The usual dose is 650 mg every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days. The patient should be instructed to notify the physician if ringing in the ears or visual disturbance occurs. Quinine has a skeletal muscle relaxant effect, increasing the re- fractory period by direct action on the mus- cle fiber ., decreasing the excitability of the motor end-plate by a curariform action, and affecting the distribution of calcium within the muscle fiber. Therefore, it is used for the prevention and treatment of nocturnal recumbency leg cramps in a dose of 260 to 300 mg at bedtime. Daily doses of 0.2 to 0.4 g as a tonic or as an analgesic in the treatment of colds were used exten- sively in the past. Over 1.65 million avoirdupois ounces of quinine and over 1.2 million ounces of quinidine are imported annually into the United States. PRESCRIPTION AND NONPRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Quinamm®, Quinite®, Strema, Quine®. ISOQUINOUNE ALKALOIDS The isoquinoline structure occurs in a considerable number of alkaloids in widely separated plant families. Although the more important opium al- kaloids (morphine, codeine, thehaine) ex- hibit a phenanthrene nucleus, the majority of its alkaloids have the isoquinoline ring structure. These phenanthrene alkaloids are derived biosynthetically from benzyli-
