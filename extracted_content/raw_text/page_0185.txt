(Photo courtesy of Dr. Jerry L. McLaughlin.) and is widely cultivated in tropical coun- tries, notably in Indonesia, Sri Lanka., and Central and South America, particularly Brazil. More than 600,000 tons are pro- duced annually in the latter country. The yield from one tree is between 0.5 and 5 kg The fruit is a small spheroidal or ellip- soidal drupe with 2 locules, each contain- ing one seed or coffee bean (Fig. 8-28). There are 2 methods of freeing the seeds from the parchmentlike endocarp: (1) the fruits are allowed to dry and are then bro- ken, and (2) the wet method in which the sarcocarp is removed by means of a ma- chine, and the 2 seeds with the parch- mentlike endocarp are allowed to dry in such a manner as to undergo a fermenta- tion; after drying, the endocarp is re- moved. The green seeds are sent into com- merce and roasted. Coffee seeds contain from I to 2% of caf- feine; about 0.25% of trigonelline (N-meth- ylbetairie of nicotinic acid); from 3 to 5% of tannin; about 15% of glucose anddextrin; 10 to 13% of a fatty oil consisting chiefly of olem and palmitin;. and 10 to 13% of pro- teins;They yield 4 to 7% of total ash, nearly all of which is acid-soluble. When the coffee is roasted, the seeds swell, change in color to dark brown, and develop the characteristic odor and flavor. The aroma is caused by an oil known as caffeol, consisting of about 50% furfurol with traces of valerianic acid, phenol, and pyridine. It is produced during the roasting process. At the same time, the caffeine is freed from its combination with chioro- genic acid with which it exists in the un- roasted seed. The caffeine may be partially sublimed during this roasting process; much of the caffeine of commerce is col- lected in condensers attached to coffee roasters. The action of coffee depends principally on the caffeine, which acts on the central nervous system, the kidneys, the muscles, and the heart. However, chlorogenic,acid and caffeol are also physiologically active, and some of the unpleasant side effects connected with coffee consumption, at least in certain persons, have been attrib- uted to these compounds. The usual cup of brewed coffee contains about 100 to 150 mg of caffeine and a cup of instant coffee contains about 85 to 100 mg of caffeine. For comparative purposes of caffeine content, a cup of tea contains 60 to 75 mg; of cocoa, 5 to 40 mg; and 12 oz of cola drink, 40 to 60 mg. The estimated maximum daily dose of caffeine is 1.5 g. Although coffee is mainly a dietetic, it is also a stimulant and a diuretic. It is of value in the treatment of poisoning by certain central nervous sys- tem depressants. Decaffeinized coffee is prepared by ex- tracting most of the caffeine from the coffee bean, yet retaining the pleasant character- istic aroma of coffee. Such preparations normally contain up to 0.08% of caffeine. Decaffeinized coffee has an extensive American market and brings a higher price than the ordinary roasted coffee. Guarana is a dried paste composed chiefly of the crushed seed of Paullinia cu- pane Kunth (Fam. Sapindaceae). The plant is a climbing shrub native to Brazil and Uruguay. The seeds are collected by the Indians and roasted over fires for about half a day; the kernels are ground with water to a pasty mass in crude stone mor-
