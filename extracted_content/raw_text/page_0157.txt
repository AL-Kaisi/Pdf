218� ALKALOIDS Codeine Codeine and its salts are narcotic anal- gesics and antitussives; they are used as sedatives, especially in allaying coughs. Although its action is similar to that of mor- phine, codeine is considerably less toxic and involves much less danger of habit for- mation. The usual dose of codeine, codeine phosphate, and codeine sulfate is: anal- gesic, 15 to 60 mg every 4 hours as needed; antitussive, 10 to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Diacetylmorphine or heroin is formed by the acetylation of morphine; the hydro- gen atoms of both the phenolic and alco- holic hydroxyl groups are replaced by ace- tyl groups. Heroin's action is similar but more pronounced than that of morphine. Because of its potency and the danger of habit formation, its manufacture in the United States is forbidden by law, and its use in medicine has been discontinued. Apomorphine hydrochloride is formed when morphine is treated with hydrochlo- ric acid in a sealed tube, and one molecule of water is lost. The compound decom- poses readily and must be rejected if an emerald green color is produced when it is shaken with distilled water (1 to 100). Apomorphine is an emetic and is partic- ularly valuable in cases of poisoning be- cause it may be administered subcutane- ously. The usual dose, subcutaneously, is 100 g per kg of body weight (maximum, 6 mg). Papaverine occurs naturally in opium . to the extent of about 1%, but it may also be produced synthetically. Papaverine hydro- chloride occurs as white crystals or as a white crystalline powder. It is odorless but has a slightly bitter taste. Papaverine hydrochloride is a smooth muscle relaxant. The usual dose, orally, is 150 mg; intramuscularly, 30 mg. Papaver- me hydrochloride is represented by Pava- bid® and Pavadyl ®. It is also used as an arititussive in combination with codeine sulfate (Copavin®). The dose of each is 15 Mg. Hydromorphone hydrochloride or di- hydromorphinone hydrochloride differs from morphine hydrochloride because one of the hydroxyl groups of morphine is re- placed by a ketone group, and the adjacent double bond is removed. It is prepared by reducing morphine in hydrochloric acid so- lution with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. HydromorphOnv The drug is a powerful narcotic analgesic and tends to strongl y, depress the respi ratory mechanism. Its dosage is smaller than that of morphine, it causes nausea and constipation less frequently than does morphine, and perhaps it is less habit- forming. The usual dose, orally and sub- cutaneously, is 2 mg every 4 hours, as needed. Dihydromorphinone hydrochlo- ride is represented by the product Dilau- did® Hydrochloride. It is the chief ingre- dient in Dilaudid cough syrup as an antitussive. Hydrocodone bitartrate or dihydroco- deinone bitartrate bears the same relation to codeine as dihydromorphinone does to morphine—a ketone group replaces one of the hydroxyl groups and the adjacent dou- ble bond is saturated. It is classed as an antitussive and is an excellent aid in treat- ing a troublesome cough. The usual dose is 5 to 10 mg, 3 to 4 times a day, as nec- essary. Dihydrocodeinone bitartrate is rep-
