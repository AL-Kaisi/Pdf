For an acid, H = K + lo ionized conc.(salt) p p a g . . d ( 'd) un -10mze cone. ac1 For a base, H = K + lo un-ionized conc.(base) p p a g . . d ( 'd) 10n1ze cone. ac1 Because the pH of body fluids varies (stomach, pH l; lumen of the intestine, pH 6.6; blood plasma, pH 7.4), the absorption of a drug from various body fluids will differ and may dictate to some extent the type of dosage form and the route of administration preferred for a given drug. Rearranging the equation for an acid yields pKa - pH = 1 un-ionized concentration (acid) og ionized concentration (acid) and one can theoretically determine the relative extent to which a drug remains un-ionized under various condi­ tions of pH. This is particularly useful when applied to body fluids. For instance, if a weak acid having a pK. of 4 is assumed to be in an environment of gastric juice with a pH of 1, the left side of the equation yields the number 3, which means that the ratio of un-ionized to ionized drug particles is about 1,000:1 and gastric absorption is excel­ lent. At the pH of plasma, the reverse is true, and in the blood, the drug is largely in the ionized form. Table 5.1 presents the effect of pH on the ionization of weak electro­ lytes, and Table 5.2 offers some representative pK. values of common drug substances. The equation and Table 5.1 show that a drug substance is half ionized at a pH value equal to its pK.. Thus, pK. TAB L E 5.1.

For example, phenobarbital has a pK. value of about 7.4, and in plasma (pH 7.4), it is present as ionized and un­ ionized forms in equal amounts. However, a drug sub­ stance cannot reach the blood plasma unless it is placed there directly through intravenous injection or is favorably absorbed from a site along its route of entry, such as the gastrointestinal tract, and allowed to pass into the general circulation. As shown in Table 5.2, phenobarbital, a weak acid with a pK. of 7.4, would be largely undissociated in the gastric environment of pH 1 and would likely be well absorbed. A drug may enter the circulation rapidly and at high concentrations if membrane penetration is easily accomplished or at a low rate and low level if the drug is not readily absorbed from its route of entry. The pH of the drug's current environment influences the rate and degree of its further distribution because under one condition of pH, it becomes more or less un-ionized and therefore more or less lipid penetrating than under another. If an un-ionized molecule is able to diffuse through the lipid barrier and remain un-ionized in the new environment, it may return to its former location or go on to a new one.
