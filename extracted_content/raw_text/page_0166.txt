CatharantFuis Alkaloids More than 70 different alkaloids have been isolated from catharanthus. Thv are generally indole and dihvdroindole deriv- atives, some of which occur in other mem- bers of the Apocvnaceae These include almalicine, tetrah ydroa1storn serpen- tine, and lochnerji-ie. The alkaloids with antineoplast-ic activity belong to a new class of dirneric indole-djhvdrojndole deriva- tives. Two of them are available at present as prescription drugs. The most characteristic effect of these drugs is the arrest of cell division at met- aphase, in a manner resembling the effect of colchicine (see page 243). Both vinhias- tine and vincristine hind tightly to tuhulin and interfere with the functioning of the microtuhule s ystem, which is a component of the mitotic spindle. Recent findings in- dicate that the alkaloids actuall y inhibit the polymerization of tubulin into microtu- b u es. Vinbiastine sulfate is the salt of an al- kaloid extracted from catharanthus It is unstable and is available in sealed am- poules, which should he stored in a refrig- erator to ensure extended stability. The al- kaloid is being used experimentally for the treatment of a wide variety of neoplasms and is recommended for generalized Hodgkin's disease, lymphocytic lym- phoma, histiocytic lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, advanced testicular carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and chorjocarcjnojna and breast cancer unresponsive to other therapies. Vinblastine is effective as a sin- gle agent but is usually administered with other antineoplastic agents in combination therapy for an enhanced therapeutic effect without additive toxicity. It is administered intravenously in doses regulated by the pa- tient's age, body surface, and white-blood- cell count. The usual dose given intrave- nously, is a single dose of 3.7 mg/m 2 of body surface for an adult and 2.5 Mg/M2 for a child, once weekl y. Each succeeding dose is increased by increments .of 1.8 mg/ m 2 for adults and 1.25 7119/rn2 for a child once a week, until a maximum dose is reached, as determined by a white-blood- cell count. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. VelbapL. Vinci-istine sulfate is also obtained from catharanthus The structure of this alkaloid is quite similar to that of vinhlastine, dif- fering onl y in the substitution of an N-for- my] group for the N-methyl group of yin- blastme. Despite the structural similarities, there are differences in the antitumor spec- tra of the 2 compounds, and no cross-re- sistance has been observed Because yin- cristine sulfate is unstable, refrigerated storage in sealed am poules is essential. It is recommended for the treatment of acute leukemia and in combination therapy in Hodgkin's disease, lvrn phosarcorna, retic- ulum cell sarconia, rhabdomyosarcorna neuroblastoma, and Wilms' tumor. The dose must be calculated and admin- istered cautiously since overdose may be fatal. It is administered intravenously at weekly intervals in doses of 1.4 mg/m 7 for adults and 2 mg/m' for children.
