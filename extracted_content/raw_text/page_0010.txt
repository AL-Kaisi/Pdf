ACID–BASE PROPERTIES Most drugs used today can be classified as acids or bases. As is noted shortly, a large number of drugs can behave as either acids or bases as they begin their journey into the patient in different dosage forms and end up in systemic circulation. A drug’s acid–base properties can greatly influ- ence its biodistribution and partitioning characteristics. Over the years, at least four major definitions of acids and bases have been developed. The model commonly used in pharmacy and biochemistry was developed independently by Lowry and Brønsted. In their definition, an acid is defined as a proton donor and a base is defined as a proton acceptor. Notice that for a base, there is no mention of the hydroxide ion. In the Brønsted-Lowry model, the acid plus base reaction can be expressed as: (Rx. 2.3) Acid/Base–Conjugate Acid/Conjugate Base Pairs Representative pairings of acids with their conjugate bases and bases with their conjugate acids are shown in Table 2.1. Careful study of this table shows water func- tioning as a proton acceptor (base) in reactions a, c, e, g, i, k, and m and a proton donor (base) in reactions b, d, f, h, j, l, and n. Hence, water is known as an amphoteric substance. Water can be either a weak base accepting a proton to form the strongly acidic hydrated proton or hy- dronium ion H3O� (reactions a, c, e, g, i, k, and m), or a weak acid donating a proton to form the strongly basic (proton accepting) hydroxide anion OH� (reactions b, d, f, h, j, l, and n). Also note the shift between un-ionized and ionized forms in Table 2.1. Examples of un-ionized acids donating their protons forming ionized conjugate bases are acetic acid- acetate (reaction g), phenobarbital-phenobarbiturate (reac- tion i), and saccharin-saccharate (reaction k). In contrast, examples of ionized acids yielding un-ionized conjugate bases are ammonium chloride-ammonia (reaction e) and ephedrine hydrochloride (reaction m). A similar shift be- tween un-ionized and ionized forms is seen with bases and their conjugate acids. Examples of un-ionized bases yield- ing their ionized conjugate acids include ammonia and ammonium (reaction f) and ephedrine and protonated ephedrine (reaction n). Whereas examples of ionized bases yielding un-ionized conjugate acids are acetate forming acetic acid (reaction h), phenobarbiturate yielding pheno- barbital (reaction j), and saccharate yielding saccharin (reac- tion l). Complicated as it may seem at first, conjugate acids and conjugate bases are nothing more than the products of an acid–base reaction. In other words, they appear to the right of the reaction arrows. Representative examples of pharmaceutically important acidic drugs are listed in Table 2.1. Each acid, or proton donor, yields a conjugate base. The latter is the product after the proton is lost from the acid. Conjugate bases range from the chloride ion (reaction a), which does not accept a proton in aqueous media, to ephedrine (reaction h), which is an ex- cellent proton acceptor. Acid Strength While any acid–base reaction can be written as an equilib- rium reaction, an attempt has been made in Table 2.1 to indicate which sequences are unidirectional or show only a small reversal. For hydrochloric acid (reaction a), the conju- gate base, Cl�, is such a weak base that it essentially does not function as a proton acceptor. In a similar manner, water is such a weak conjugate acid that there is little reverse re- action involving water donating a proton to the hydroxide anion of sodium hydroxide (reaction b). Two logical questions to ask at this point are how one predicts in which direction an acid–base reaction lies and to what extent the reaction goes to completion. The common physical chemical measurement that contains this informa- tion is known as the pKa. The pKa is the negative logarithm of the modified equilibrium constant, Ka (Eq. 2.1), for an acid–base reaction written so that water is the base or proton acceptor (reactions a, c, e, g, i, k, m, Table 2.1). Ka � (Eq. 2.1) Equation 2.1 is based on Rx. 2.3. The square brackets indicate molar concentrations. Because the molar concentra- tion of water (the base in these acid–base reactions) is consid- ered constant in the dilute solutions used in pharmacy and medicine, it is incorporated into the Ka. Rewriting Equation 2.1 by taking the negative logarithm of the Ka, results in the familiar Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Eq. 2.2). pH � pKa � log (Eq. 2.2) Warning! It is important to recognize that a pKa for a base is in reality the pKa of the conjugate acid (acid donor or protonated form, BH�) of the base. The pKa is listed in the Appendix as 9.6 for ephedrine and as 9.3 for ammonia. In reality, this is the pKa of the protonated form, such as ephedrine hydrochloride (reaction m in Table 2.1) and am- monium chloride (reaction e in Table 2.1), respectively. This is confusing to students, pharmacists, clinicians, and experienced scientists. It is crucial that the chemistry of the drug be understood when interpreting a pKa value. When reading tables of pKa values, such as those found in the Appendix, one must realize that the listed value is for the proton donor form of the molecule, no matter what form is indicated by the name. See Table 2.2 for several worked ex- amples of how the pKa is used to calculate pHs of solutions, required ratios of [conjugate base]/[acid], and percent ion- ization (discussed later) at specific pHs. Just how strong or weak are the acids whose reactions in water are illustrated in Table 2.1? Remember that the Kas or pKa’s are modified equilibrium constants that indicate the extent to which the acid (proton donor) reacts with water to form conjugate acid and conjugate base. The equilibrium for a strong acid (low pKa) in water lies to the right, favoring the formation of products (conjugate acid and conjugate base). The equilibrium for a weak acid (high pKa) in water lies to the left, meaning that the conjugate acid is a better proton donor than the parent acid is or that the conjugate base is a good proton acceptor. Refer back to Equation 2.1 and, using the Ka values in Table 2.3, substitute the Ka term for each of the acids.
