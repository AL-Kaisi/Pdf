Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 13 TABLE 2.1 Examples of Acid–Base Reactions (with the Exception of Hydrochloric Acid, Whose Conjugate Base [Cl�] Has No Basic Properties in Water, and Sodium Hydroxide, which Generates Hydroxide, the Reaction of the Conjugate Base in Water Is Shown for Each Acid) Acid � Base Conjugate Acid � Conjugate Base Hydrochloric acid (a) HCl � H2O H3O� � Cl� Sodium hydroxide (b) H2O � NaOH H2O � OH�(Na�)a Sodium dihydrogen phosphate and its conjugate base, sodium monohydrogen phosphate (c) H2PO4�(Na�)a � H2O H3O� � HPO42�(Na�)a (d) H2O � HPO42�(2Na�)a H2PO42�(Na�)a � OH�(Na�)a Ammonium chloride and its conjugate base, ammonia (e) NH4�(Cl�)a � H2O H3O�(Cl�)a � NH3 (f) H2O � NH3 NH4� � OH� Acetic acid and its conjugate base, sodium acetate (g) CH3COOH � H2O H3O� � CH3COO� (h) H2O � CH3COO�(Na�)a CH3COOH � OH�(Na�)a Indomethacin and its conjugate base, indomethacin sodium, show the identical acid–base chemistry as acetic acid and sodium acetate, respectively. Phenobarbital and its conjugate base, phenobarbital sodium (i) � H2O H3O� � (j) H2O � � OH�(Na�)a Saccharin and its conjugate base, saccharin sodium (k) � H2O H3O� � (l) H2O � � OH�(Na�)a Ephedrine HCl and its conjugate base, ephedrine (m) � H2O H3O�(Cl�)a � (n) H2O � � OH� aThe chloride anion and sodium cation are present only to maintain charge balance. These anions play no other acid–base role.
