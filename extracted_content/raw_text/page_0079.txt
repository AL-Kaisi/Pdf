both the lactone and the hydroxy acid bind equally well to human serum albumin. N-Demethylation of the tertiary amine to give the secondary amine is mediated by CYP3A4 and represents a minor route of metabolism. Glucuronidation of the parent and the phase I metabolites also occurs to a lim- ited (10%) extent.112 Elimination occurs primarily in the urine, with 30% of the dose being recovered as unchanged drug. The terminal elimination half-life is 2 to 3 hours. The major toxicity seen for topotecan is dose-limiting myelosup- pression. Nausea and vomiting are seen in most (70%–80%) patients, along with diarrhea and abdominal pain. Other tox- icities include headache myalgias, alopecia and elevation of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatases, and bilirubin. Microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine) may also be seen. Bleomycin Bleomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic complex isolated from Streptomyces verticillus initially by Umezawa.113 At least 13 different fractions of bleomycin have been isolated with the clinically used product (Blenoxane) being a mix- ture of predominantly A2 (55%–70%) and B2 (25%–32%) fractions (Fig. 10.18). Of these fractions, A2 appears to pos- sess the greatest antineoplastic activity. Copper is found in the naturally occurring material, and its removal is impor- tant for the material used clinically because it significantly reduces activity. Bleomycin binds Fe�2 through multiple interactions with the amino terminal end of the peptide chain (Fig. 10.19).114 Bleomycin may itself initiate the release of iron necessary for this complexation. Interaction with DNA subsequently occurs through the bithiazole portion of the molecule, which intercalates between G-C base pairs with a preference for genes undergoing transcription. Held in proximity to DNA by this interaction, in an aerobic environment, Fe�2 is oxi- dized to Fe�3 in a one-electron process with the electron being transferred to molecular oxygen.115 This gives the ac- tivated form of bleomycin, which has been formulated as HOO�Fe(III)-bleomycin, which is believed to possess square bipyramidal geometry. This then results in the pro- duction of ROS in the form of superoxide and hydroxide radical, which initiate single-strand breakage of the phos- phodiester backbone and release of DNA bases by oxidative cleavage of the 3�-4� bond of the deoxyribose moiety.116 This activity may be enhanced in the presence of mercap- tans such as glutathione, which can facilitate the action of reductase enzymes in reducing the Fe�3 that is generated back to Fe�2 so that the process may continue. The agent is most active in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. NMR studies of bleomycin complexed with cobalt have confirmed the intercalation of the bithiazole with adjacent G-C base pairs with the dimethylsulfonium chain (bleomycin A2) projecting into the major groove where the sulfonium cation may interact with the phosphate backbone 394 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Scheme 10.29 Metabolism of irinotecan.
