Alkaloids Alkaloids are extremely difficult to de- fine because they do not represent a ho- mogeneous group of compounds from either the chemical, biochemical, or phys- iologic viewpoint. Consequently, except for the fact that they are all organic nitrog- enous compounds with a limited distri- bution in nature, reservations must he ap- pended to any general definition.

In spite of the difficulties attending a precise definition, the term alkaloid is extremely useful and is commonly applied to basic nitrogenous compounds of plant origin that are phys- iologically active In the plant kingdom, the alkaloids ap- pear to have a restricted distribution in cer- tain families and genera. This observation is based on the incomplete investigations of plants up to the present time; consid- erable research must be accomplished be- fore definite statements concerning the oc- currence of alkaloids can be made. Among the angiosperms, the Leguminosae, Pa- paveraceae, Ranunculaceae, Rubiaceae, Solanaceae, and l3erberidaceae are out- standing alkaloid-yielding plants. The La- biatae and Rosaceae are almost free of al- kaloids; the gymnosperms only rarely contain them (Taxaceae). Although it has been claimed that the monocotyledons do not generally produce alkaloids, investi- gations indicate that the Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceac are 2 of the most promising families (of a list of 11) in which to search for alkaloid-yielding plants. Specific alkaloids of complex structures are ordinarily confined to specific plant families (byoscyamine in Solanaceae, cot- chicine in Liliaceae). Nicotine, which is found in a number of widely scattered pid ilt Ia ni'ilies, is not an exception to this rule because of the biosynthetic simplicity of its structure. However, the occurrence of ergot alkaloids in the fungus Claviceps purpurea and certain Ipomoea species (Con- volvulaceae) is a definite exception and may be attributed to either parallel or con- vergent evolution of certain complex bio- chemical pathways. Alkaloids may occur in various parts of the plant: in seeds (phy- sostigma, areca), in fruits (conium), in leaves (belladonna, coca), in underground stems (sanguinaria), in roots (belladonna root), in rhizomes and roots (ipecac, hy- drastis), and in barks (cinchona). They are also found in the fungi (ergot, Amanita cii- rina). The names of the alkaloids are obtained in various ways: (1) from the generic name of the plant yielding them (hydrastine, atropine), (2) from the specific name of the 186
