seems to play an especially important role and compounds lacking this functionality failed to inhibit the enzyme. In the case of doxorubicin and daunorubicin, specificity is provided by the hydrogen bonding between O-9 of the anthracycline and N-2 and N-3 of guanine. The x-ray data also suggested that the interaction with DNA is stabilized by the formation of several hydrogen bonds through bridging water mole- cules.75 The formation of covalent bonds between anthracy- clines and DNA also is supported by several studies in which formaldehyde is produced by oxidation of cellular compo- nents or other anthracycline molecules. This oxidation results from the production of ROS such as H2O2, which are gener- ated during redox cycling of anthracyclines (Scheme 10.24). The generated formaldehyde may then form a methylene bridge between the 4�-amino group of the anthracycline and the 2-amino group of guanine in DNA.76 Although the anthracyclines produce several adverse effects that are typical for antineoplastics, cardiotoxicity is a special concern with this class of agents. The associated car- diomyopathies and congestive heart failure (CHF) have been related to the ability of these compounds to undergo redox cycling.77 This is most notable in the case of daunorubicin and doxorubicin and less of a problem in the newer deriva- tives, idarubicin and epirubicin. The C ring of the anthracy- clines is subject to a one or two electron reduction by several different enzymes including NAD(P)H-oxidoreductases and CYP reductases to give the semiquinone or hydroquinone. The case of the one electron reduction is shown in Scheme 10.25. This may undergo reversion to the starting quinone in futile redox cycling accompanied by the production of super- oxide radical. The radical is normally converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase and H2O2 is then converted to H2O and O2 by catalase. However, the production of superoxide (O2��) is also associated with the release of iron from intra- cellular stores, which may be chelated by the anthracycline. The iron then diverts the normal detoxification pathway by catalase so that more potent radicals such as hydroxyl radical (�OH) are produced. Myocardial cells possess lower levels of catalase and therefore are less able to detoxify the H2O2 that results from redox cycling. This results in increasing levels of �OH for which a detoxification pathway does not exist and therefore cellular damage occurs. Materials such as O2��, �OH, and H2O2 are known as reactive oxygen species or ROS and in sufficiently high concentration produce cellular dam- age. Hydroxyl radicals cause single-strand breaks in DNA, which would activate p53 and enhance apoptosis in cardiac cells. Studies have also shown that doxorubicin administra- tion stimulates both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of 386 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Scheme 10.24 Formation of anthracycline-DNA adduct.
