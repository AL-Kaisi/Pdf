in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head neck, cervix, penis, and vulva. It is also used in Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma as well as testicular carci- noma. Unlabeled uses include the treatment of mycosis fun- goides, osteosarcoma, and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. Bleomycin given intravenously has a distribution half- life of 10 to 20 minutes with a small volume of distribution of 20 L. The major metabolite results from hydrolysis of the amide at C-1 to give the inactive carboxylic acid. The drug is primarily eliminated in the kidneys with 60% to 70% of the drug recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. The serum elimination is related to glomerular filtration rate, such that those patients with a creatinine clearance greater than 35 mL/min have a serum total elimination half-life of 115 minutes, and in those with a creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min, the serum total elimination half-life expo- nentially increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. Dermatological reactions are the most commonly seen adverse effect with erythema, hyperpigmentation, rash, and tenderness occurring in 50% of the patients taking the drug. The most serious adverse effect is the pulmonary fibrosis previously mentioned. Treatment with bleomycin can in- crease the risk of pulmonary toxicity that may occur if the patient is subsequently administered oxygen during surgery. Vinca Alkaloids The vinca alkaloids (Fig. 10.21) are extracted from the leaves of Catharanthus roseus (periwinkle), and were originally in- vestigated for their hypoglycemic properties but latter found to possess antineoplastic actions.120 The alkaloids are com- posed of a catharanthine moiety containing the indole sub- unit and the vindoline moiety containing the dihydroindole subunit joined by a carbon–carbon bond. Vincristine and vin- blastine differ only in the group attached to the dihydroindole nitrogen, which is a methyl group in vinblastine and a formyl group in vincristine. Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic material resulting from loss of water across the 3�,4� bond and first prepared by the use of a modified Polonovski reaction of vinblastine followed by hydrolysis.121 The vinca alkaloids were initially believed to gain entry into the cell by an energy-dependent process, but more recent work suggests that entry occurs by an energy- and tempera- ture-independent mechanism similar to passive diffusion. The agents then begin to accumulate in cells with intracellu- lar concentrations 5- to 500-fold higher than extracellular concentrations. Once in the cell, the vincas bind to tubulin disrupting formation and function of the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is composed of the microtubules, which function as part of the cell’s cytoskeleton and are im- portant in maintaining cellular shape. They are also involved in transport within the cell and cell signaling as well as play- ing a pivotal role in the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. The microtubules are composed of heterodimers of �-tubulin and �-tubulin, which may arrange as alternating heterodimers around a hollow axis to form the protofila- ments of the microtubule. The behavior of the microtubules are regulated in part by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which may bind to soluble tubulin or the micro- tubules themselves.122 As part of the mitotic process, the length of the microtubule will change because of polymer- ization and depolymerization of the associated tubulin. Tubulin is capable of binding guanosine-5�-triphosphate (GTP) and hydrolyzing it to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). When this hydrolysis occurs and Pi dissociates another tubulin-GTP complex adds to the microtubule. This forms the GTP cap and as long as tubulin- GTP or tubulin-GDP with associated Pi is present at the end 396 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 10.21 Structures of vinca alkaloids.
