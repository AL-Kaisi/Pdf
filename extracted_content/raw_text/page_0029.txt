the drug into its stereoisomers. An example is the calcium channel antagonist verapamil, which illustrates why it is dif- ficult to conclude that one isomer is superior to the other. S- Verapamil is a more active pharmacological stereoisomer than R-verapamil, but the former is more rapidly metabo- lized by the first-pass effect. First-pass refers to orally ad- ministered drugs that are extensively metabolized as they pass through the liver (see Chapter 3). S- and R-warfarin are metabolized by two different cytochrome P450 isozymes. Drugs that either inhibit or induce these enzymes can signif- icantly affect warfarinâ€™s anticoagulation activity. Because of biotransformations after the drug is adminis- tered, it sometimes makes little difference whether a racemic mixture or one isomer is administered. The popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen is sold as the racemic mixture. The S-enantiomer contains the anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting cyclooxygenase. The R-isomer does have centrally acting analgesic activity, but it is converted to the S form in vivo (Fig. 2.18). In addition to the fact that most receptors are asymmet- ric, there are other reasons why stereoisomers show differ- ent biological responses. Active transport mechanisms involve asymmetric carrier molecules, which means that there will be preferential binding of one stereoisomer over others. When differences in physical properties exist, the distribution of isomers between body fluids and tissues where the receptors are located will differ. The enzymes re- sponsible for drug metabolism are asymmetric, which means that biological half-lives will differ among possible stereoisomers of the same molecule. The latter may be a very important variable because the metabolite may actually be the active molecule. Figure 2.17 Examples of drug stereoisomers. Chapter 2 Drug Design Strategies 31
