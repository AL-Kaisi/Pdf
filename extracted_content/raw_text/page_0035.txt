investigator toward the next molecule that should be synthe- sized. To get around the problem of strict alignment of one particular conformation with another, there are methods that sample several possible conformations of a set of possible ligands. This is called 4D-QSAR.39 The CoMFA methodology is used in similarity analyses comparing molecular conformers’ ability to bind to a recep- tor. This is called comparative molecular similarity indices analysis or CoMSIA.40 It is similar to CoMFA in that the molecules are aligned in a grid, but differs in the type of in- dices or descriptors with Gaussian functions producing de- scriptors that describe binding to the receptor being the most useful. Database Searching and Mining As pointed out previously, receptors can be isolated and cloned. This means that it is possible to determine their structures. Most are proteins and that means having to deter- mine their amino acid sequence. This can be done either by degrading the protein or by obtaining the nucleotide se- quence of the structural gene coding for the receptor and using the triplet genetic code to determine the amino acid sequence. The parts of the receptor that bind the drug (lig- and) can be determined by site-directed mutagenesis. This alters the nucleotide sequence at specific points on the gene and, therefore, changes specific amino acids. Also, keep in mind that many enzymes become receptors when the goal is to alter their activity. Examples of the latter include acetyl- cholinesterase, monoamine oxidase, HIV protease, rennin, ACE, and tetrahydrofolate reductase. The starting point is a database of chemical structures. They may belong to large pharmaceutical or agrochemical firms that literally have synthesized the compounds in the database and have them sitting on the shelf. Alternatively, the database may be constructed so that several different chemical classes and substituent patterns are represented. (See discussion of isosterism in the next section.) The first step is to convert the traditional or historical two- dimensional molecules into 3D structures whose intramole- cular distances are known. Keeping in mind the problems of finding the “correct” conformation for flexible molecule, false hits and misses might result from the search. Next, the dimensions of the active site must be determined. Ideally, the receptor has been crystallized, and from the coordinates, the intramolecular distances between what are assumed to be key locations are obtained. If the receptor cannot be crystallized, there are methods for estimating the 3D shape based on searching crystallographic databases and matching amino acid sequences of proteins whose tertiary structure has been determined. Fortunately, the crystal structures of literally thousands of proteins have been determined, and their structures have been stored in the Brookhaven Protein Databank. It is now known that proteins with similar functions have similar amino acid sequences in various regions of the protein. These sequences tend to show the same shapes in terms of �-helix, parallel and antiparallel �-pleated forms, turns in the chain, etc. Using this information plus molecular mechanics parameters, the shape of the protein and the di- mensions of the active site can be estimated. Figure 2.25 contains the significant components of a hypothetical ac- tive site. Notice that four amino acid residues at positions 25, 73, 102, and 147 have been identified as important ei- ther for binding the ligand to the site or for the receptor’s intrinsic activity. Keep in mind that Figure 2.25 is a two- dimensional representation of a 3D image. Therefore, the distances between amino acid residues must take into ac- count the fact that each residue is above or below the planes of the other three residues. For an artificial ligand to “dock,” or fit into the site, six distances must be consid- ered: (a) Lys–Glu, (b) Glu–Phe, (c) Phe–Ser, (d) Ser–Lys, (e) Glu–Phe, and (f) Lys–Phe. In reality, not all six dis- tances may be important. In selecting potential ligands, candidates might include a positively charged residue (protonated amine), aromatic ring, hydrogen bond donor or acceptor (hydroxy, phenol, amine, nitro), and hydrogen bond acceptor or a negatively charged residue (carboxyl- ate) that will interact with the aspartate, phenylalanine, serine, and lysine residues, respectively. A template is con- structed containing the appropriate residues at the proper distances with correct geometries, and the chemical data- base is searched for molecules that fit the template. A de- gree of fit or match is obtained for each “hit.” Their bio- logical responses are obtained, and the model for the receptor is further refined. New, better-defined ligands may be synthesized. In addition to the interatomic distances, the chemical databases will contain important physicochemical values in- cluding partition coefficients, electronic terms, molar refrac- tivity, pKa’s, solubilities, and steric values. Arrangements of atoms may be coded by molecular connectivity or other topological descriptors. The result is a “flood of data” that requires interpretation, large amounts of data storage, and rapid means of analysis. Compounds usually must fit within defined limits that estimate ADME. Chemical databases can contain hundreds of thousands of molecules that could be suitable ligands for a receptor. But, no matter how good the fit is to the receptor, the candi- date molecule is of no use if the absorption is poor or if the drug is excreted too slowly from the body. An analysis of 2,245 drugs has led to a set of “rules” called the Lipinski Figure 2.25 Diagram of a hypothetical receptor site, showing distances between functional groups.
