Toxicities include myelosuppression, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, nausea and vomiting anorexia, diarrhea, and mucositis. Neurotoxicity is usually expressed as ataxia, lethargy, and confusion. An allergic reaction often described in pediatric patients includes fever, myalgia, malaise, bone pain, skin rash, conjunctivitis, and chest pain. FLOXURIDINE (FLUORODEOXYURIDINE, FUDR) The drug is available as a 500-mg vial of lyophilized pow- der. The drug is used to treat metastatic GI adenocarcinoma. The mechanism of action of this fluoropyrimidine deoxynu- cleoside analog involves metabolic conversion to 5-fluo- rouracil (5-FU) metabolites resulting in inhibition of TS thus disrupting DNA synthesis, function, and repair. Resistance can occur because of increased expression of TS, decreased levels of reduced folate 5,10-methylenetetrahy- drofolate, increased activity of DNA repair enzymes, and in- creased expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (the major catabolic enzyme). The drug is poorly absorbed from the GI tract and is extensive metabolized to 5-FU and 5-FU metabolites. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase is the main enzyme responsible for 5-FU catabolism, and it is present in liver, GI mucosa, white blood cells, and kidney. The drug interaction and toxicity profiles are equivalent to those of 5-FU. GEMCITABINE (DFDC, GEMZAR) The drug is available as the hydrochloride salt in 200- and 1,000-mg lyophilized single-dose vials for IV use. Gemcitabine is used to treat bladder cancer, breast cancer, Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 381 Scheme 10.23 Interconversion of various folate species. (DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase.)
