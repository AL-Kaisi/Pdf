568 section ix Special Topics (A) β-Carotene is only an antioxidant at low concentrations of oxygen; at higher concentrations of oxygen it is an autocatalytic pro-oxidant. Vitamin E forms a stable radical that is capable of either undergoing reaction with water-soluble antioxidants or penetrating further into lipoproteins and tissues, so increasing radical damage. ■ Radicals are important in cell signaling, and especially in signaling for apoptosis of cells that have suffered DNA damage. It is likely that high concentrations of antioxidants, so far from protecting against tissue damage, may quench the signaling radicals, and so permit the continued survival of damaged cells, so increasing, rather than decreasing, the risk of cancer development.

Nitric oxide and other radicals are important in cell sig- naling, and especially in signaling for programmed cell death (apoptosis) of cells that have suffered DNA and other dam- age. It is likely that high concentrations of antioxidants, so far from protecting against tissue damage, may quench the signaling radicals, and so permit the continued survival of damaged cells, so increasing, rather than decreasing, the risk of cancer development. SUMMARY ■ Free radicals are highly reactive molecular species with an unpaired electron. They can react with, and modify, proteins, nucleic acids and fatty acids in cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins. ■ Radical damage to lipids and proteins in plasma lipoproteins is a factor in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease; radical damage to nucleic acids may induce heritable mutations and cancer; radical damage to proteins may lead to the development of autoimmune diseases. ■ Oxygen radicals arise as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation, nonenzymic reactions of transition metal ions, the respiratory burst of activated macrophages, and the normal oxidation of reduced flavin coenzymes. ■ Protection against radical damage is afforded by enzymes that remove superoxide ions and hydrogen peroxide, enzymic reduction of lipid peroxides linked to oxidation of glutathione, nonenzymic reaction of lipid peroxides with vitamin E, and reaction of radicals with compounds such as vitamins C and E, carotene, ubiquinone, uric acid, and dietary polyphenols that form relatively stable radicals that persist long enough to undergo reaction to nonradical products. ■ Except in people who were initially deficient, intervention trials of vitamin E and β-carotene have generally shown increased mortality among those taking the supplements.
