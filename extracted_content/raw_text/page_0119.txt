911 Asthma | CHAPTER 79 • Three ultra-LABAs (indacaterol [Arcapta Neohaler], olodaterol [Striverdi Respi- mat], and vilanterol) have a 24-hour bronchodilator duration of effect. Only vilanterol in combination with fluticasone furoate (with and without umeclidinium) is available for once-daily dosing for asthma in adults ≥18 years old in the United States. Products containing indacaterol and olodaterol are only indicated for COPD but are being evaluated for asthma. • Table 79-2 contains dosing guidelines for acute severe asthma exacerbations.
