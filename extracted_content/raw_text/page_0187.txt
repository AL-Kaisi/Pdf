248� ALKALOIDS generic name is Greek and means goddess; sinensis refers to its Chinese origin. Green tea is prepared in China and Japan by rapidly drying the freshly picked leaves in copper pans over a mild artificial heat. The leaves are often rolled in the palm of the hand as they dry. Black tea is prepared in Sri Lanka and India by heaping the fresh leaves until fer- mentation has begun. They are then rap- idly dried artificially with heat. Tea occurs as more or less crumpled, bright green or blackish green masscs. Its odor is agreeable and aromatic; its taste is pleasantly astringent and bitter. Tea contains 1 to 4% of caffeine (theme) and small amounts of adenine, theobro- mine, theophvlline, and xanthine; about l5% of gallotannic acid; and about 0.75% a yellow volatile oil that is solid at or- hoary temperatures and has a strongly ar- rnatic odor and taste. The stimulating action of tea is essen- tially that of the contained caffeine; its astringent properties are owing to the tan- nin content. Tea leaf waste and tea dust represent important sources for the extrac- Lion of caffeine. Theophylline or 1,3-dimethvlxanthine :s isomeric with theobromine and was first •solated from tea in 1885. It is prepared -, yntheticall y from caffeine or by other means. Theophylline occurs as a white, odorless, bitter crystalline powder that is soluble in about 120 parts of water. It is rendered more soluble when combined with basic compounds. Aminophylline or theophyllinc ethylenediamine, theophyl- line monoethanola mine, choline theophvl- linate, and theophylline sodium glycinate are commonly employed in medicine. USES AND DOSE. Theophylline and re- lated compounds are utilized principally as smooth muscle relaxants for the sympto- matic relief or prevention of bronchial asthma and for the treatment of reversible bronchospasrn associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In addition, theophylline possesses diuretic properties. The usual dose of theophylline is, orally, the equivalent of 2.4 mg of anhydrous theophylline per kg of body weight every 6 hours initially, adjusted as necessary to control symptoms with a usual optimal dosage of 4.8 mg per kg of body weight every 6 hours. The usual dose of amino- phylline is, orally, 3 mg per kg of body weight every 6 hours adjusted as necessary to an optimal dosage of 6 mg per kg every 6 hours and, intravenously, 250 to 500 n-ig every 6 hours. Aminophylline is also a valuable di- uretic. It exhibits dilating action on the put monary vessels in relieving asthma and can lower venous pressure in certain cases of heart failure. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Theophylline: Bronkodvl®, Theophyl ®, Theospan, Theolair®, Accurhron®, Sustaire; amino- phylline: Somophyllin ®, Phyllocontin®; theophylline sodium glycinate: Glynazan®, SynOphylate; choline theophvllinate; Choledyl® . Tedral® and Bronkotabs con- tain theophylline in combination. Theobromine Theobromine or 3,7-dimethyixanthine is a compound prepared from the dried, ripe seed of Theobroma cacao Linné (Fam. Sterculiaceae) or is made synthetically. It occurs as a white, crystalline powder with a bitter taste and sublimes at about 260 C. The base is slightly soluble in cold water or in alcohol but is readily soluble when mixed with salts that form basic solutions, such as calcium salicylate, sodium acetate, or sodium salicylate. USES AND DOSE. Theobromine is a di- uretic and a smooth muscle relaxant. It has little stimulant actin on the central nerv- ous system and hence is preferred over caf- feine in treatment of cardiac edema and of angina pectoris. The usual dose is 200 mg, 3 times daily.
