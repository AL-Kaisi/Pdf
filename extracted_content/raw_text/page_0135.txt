196� ALKALOIDS an anticholinergic. It is used to aid in the control of gastric secretion, visceral spasm, hypermotility in spastic colitis, pyloro- spasm, and associated abdominal cramps. In parkmsonism it is used to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated si- alorrhea and hyperhidrosis. The usual dose, oral or sublingual, is 125 to 250 ig. 3 or 4 times a day. The parenteral dose is 250 to 500 p.g given subcutaneously, intra- muscularly, or intravenously, 3 or 4 times a day, as needed. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Levsin, An- aspaz, Levamine®, Cystospaz®. Atropine is an alkaloid obtained from bo- tanical sources (from Afro pa belladonna Linné, from species of Datura Linné, and from I-I yoscya rnus Ljnné fFam. Solanaceae]) or produced synthetically. It is extremely poisonous. Synthetic production of atro- pine is more costly than extraction from natural sources and cannot compete in price. Formerly, Hyoscyainus muticus rep- resented the chief natural source; however, atropine is now also obtained from species of Duboisia (see page 199). It pre-exists in the solanaceous plants only in traces and is formed from hvoscyamine during the process of extraction. Atropine occurs as colorless, needlelike crystals or as a white, crystalline powder; it is optically inactive but usually contains some ievorotatorv hyoscyamine, the limit of which produces an angular rotation not to exceed —0.700 . Atropine sulfate occurs as colorless crys- tals or as a white, crystalline powder. It is extremely poisonous. It effloresces in dry air, is slowly affected by light, and is an anticholinergic. USE AND DOSE. Atropine sulfate is an an- ticholinergic. Used in surgery as an anti- sialogogue to control bronchial, nasal, pha- ryngeal, and salivary secretions, it is usually injected intramuscularly prior to induction of anesthesia. During surgery, the drug is given intravenously when re- duction in pulse range and cessation of car- diac action are attributable to increased vagal activity. It is also useful in pyloro- spasm and other spastic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and for ureteral and biliary colic when administered concomi- tantly with morphine. The usual dose, tab- lets, is 300 to 600 fig, 3 or 4 times a day; injection, 400 to 600 l.Lg, 4 to 6 times a day, and as an antidote to cholinesterase inhib- itors, intravenously, 2 to 4 mg initially, fol- lowed by 2 mg intramuscularly, repeated every 5 to 10 minutes until muscarinic symptoms disappear or signs of atropine toxicity appear; topically to the conjunc- tiva, 0.1 ml of a 0.5 to 4% solution, 3 times a day. Scopolamine or hyoscine is an alkaloid that is particularly abundant in Datura fas tuo.sa var. alba and in D. metel. It is an ester that, upon hydrolysis, yields tropic acid and scopoline, a base resembling tropine. It occurs as an almost colorless, syrupy liquid from its chioroformic solution and as colorless crystals from its ether solution, It is levorotatory. Scopolamine hydrobromide or hyoscine hydrobromide occurs as colorless or white crystals or as a white, granular powder that is odorless and slightly efflorescent in dry air. It is extremely poisonous. USE AND DOSE. Scopolamine hydrobro- mide is classified as an anticholinergic. At usual therapeutic doses, scopolamine is a central nervous system depressant, whereas atropine is a stimulant. For this reason, scopolamine hydrobromide is used for preanesthetic sedation and for obstetric amnesia in conjunction with analgesics; it is also employed for calming delirium. It is administered subcutaneously or intramus- cularly in a single dose of 320 to 650 g. In addition to its systemic anticholinergic effects, scopolamine is effective in the pre- vention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, it is applied as the free base in a transdermal system behind the ear at least 4 hours before the antic- metic effect is required. The scopolamine is gradually released from an adhesive ma- trix of mineral oil and po]yisobutylene. A
