108 SECTION 2 | Cardiovascular Disorders FIGURE 9-2. General management algorithm for acute decompensated heart failure based on clinical presentation. Patients may be categorized into a hemodynamic subset based on signs and symptoms or invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Adjunct strategies for overcoming diuretic resistance include increasing the dose of loop diuretic; switching to a continuous infusion; adding a diuretic with an alternative mechanism of action, an IV vasodilator, or an IV inotrope; and in select patients, adding mechanical circulatory support.
