several unlabeled uses in various cancers in combination with other agents including therapy for small cell lung can- cer, NSCLC, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Epirubicin is the 4�-epimer of doxorubicin, which exhibits a lower level of cardiotoxicity compared with doxorubicin. The reduced cardiotoxicity has been at- tributed to the epimerization of 4�-OH, which places this –OH function in an equatorial position resulting in increased glucuronidation, faster clearance, and reduced metabolic re- duction to epirubicinol, the C-13 alcohol (compared with doxorubicin). The glucuronide, which forms via glu- curonidation of the 4�-alcohol, is the major metabolite found in plasma and urine.88 Epirubicinol that does form has little cytotoxic activity. Other minor metabolites that are seen are the aglycones of epirubicin and epirubicinol. These factors have allowed epirubicin to be used in larger doses than dox- orubicin with less cardiotoxicity. Other toxicities typical of the class are also seen with epirubicin. Like doxorubicin, it has a short distributive half-life of 5 minutes; however, plasma levels are 20% to 30% lower with an increased vol- ume of distribution. The agent has an elimination half-life of 16 hours, which is shorter than that of doxorubicin. Epirubicin is eliminated primarily by biliary excretion. IDARUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE (4-DEMETHOXYDAUNOMYCIN, DMDR, IDAMYCIN) Idarubicin is available in 5-, 10-, and 20-mL vials for IV ad- ministration in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The compound lacks the 4-methoxy group and terminal side-chain alcohol of doxoru- bicin making it the most lipophilic of the four major anthra- cyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin), and it is considered less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin. The removal of the 4-methoxy group also increases inhibition of topoisomerase II. The drug has a fast distributive phase and a high volume of distribution reflecting binding to tissue. Concentrations in blood and bone marrow cells are 100 times higher than those found in plasma, reflecting its use in treat- ing leukemias. Metabolism of the agent primarily occurs by conversion to idarubicinol via reduction of the side chain ke- tone to the alcohol, which retains activity as an antineoplas- tic. Elimination occurs primarily in the bile. Adverse effects are similar to those found for doxorubicin; however, there is a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity. VALRUBICIN (AD 32, VALSTAR) Valrubicin is available in 200-mg vials for intravesicular ad- ministration in the treatment of bladder cancer (orphan drug status). The increased lipophilicity associated with the va- leric acid ester and trifluoro acetate functionalities increases tissue penetration and remains intact because, in large mea- sure, of the lack of exposure to hydrolyzing enzymes caused by direct delivery into the bladder followed by voiding of the instilled solution. This local action also minimizes car- diotoxicity and other adverse effects seen with other anthra- cyclines. The major adverse effects that are seen are bladder irritation and reddening of the urine. MITOXANTRONE HCL (DHAD, NOVANTRONE) Mitoxantrone is supplied as a blue aqueous solution in 10- and 20-mg vials for IV administration in the treatment of acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and multiple sclerosis. The mechanisms of resistance are the same as those seen for the anthracyclines. The distribution half-life is 1.1 to 3.1 hours, and the drug has a large volume of distribution (11 L/kg). The elimination half-life ranged from 23 to 215 hours, and elimination was primarily via the bile. Metabolism of the agent involves oxidation of the side- chain alcohols to give the monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids.89 Other toxicities are those seen for the anthracyclines and include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea, and alopecia. The intense color of the parent drug and metabolites may turn the urine blue. Epipodophyllotoxins The epipodophyllotoxins (Fig. 10.15) are semisynthetic de- rivatives of podophyllotoxin, which is isolated from the mayapple (mandrake) root and functions as an inhibitor of microtubule function.90,91 Chemical modification has led to compounds with a different mechanism of action, which in- volves inhibition of topoisomerase enzymes.92,93 The change in mechanism was associated with removal of the 4�-methyl group of podophyllotoxin. Further alteration in podophyllotoxin involved the addition of the glycosidic por- tion of the molecules. Etoposide acts on topoisomerase II stabilizing the cleav- able complex leading to single- and double-strand breaks. If enough breaks are initiated, apoptosis is activated. Etoposide is believed to bind to topoisomerase II in the absence of DNA, because it shows little tendency to interact with DNA alone.94,95 The etoposide-topoisomerase II complex then binds DNA, and strand cleavage occurs; how- ever, the ligation step is inhibited. Binding of the drug oc- curs near the site at which the cleaved phosphodiester bond is held by the enzyme. One etoposide molecule stabilizes the cleavable complex of one chain, and therefore two etoposide molecules are necessary to mediate double-strand breaks.96 The concentration of the agent will then determine whether single- or double-strand breaks occur. The resulting breaks in normal cells may lead to mutations and translocations that have been associated with the development of leukemias posttreatment. The agents are considered cell cycle specific and act in the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The glycosidic moiety of the epipodophyllotoxins, which is lacking in podophyllotoxin, is associated with converting these compounds from tublin binders to topoisomerase in- hibitors. Replacement of the glycosidic 8-methyl group with thiophene gives tenoposide, which is 10-fold more potent than etoposide. The glycosidic moiety is not an absolute re- quirement for activity, and other more active compounds are known in which it has been replaced. The 4�-OH group is im- portant for the activity of the compounds, and loss of this functionality results in greatly reduced levels of strand breaks. Removal of one of the adjacent methoxy groups by CYP3A4 mediated oxidative-O-dealkylation gives the catechol analogs, which are more potent than the parent mole- cules.97,98 The catechol analogs may be further oxidized to give the quinones, which are also more active than the parent (Scheme 10.27). There are several mechanisms by which cells become resistant to the epipodophyllotoxins including increased efflux by Pgp as seen for many of the other natural products. Additionally, topoisomerase II levels may decrease Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 389
