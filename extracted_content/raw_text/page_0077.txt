cancers.99 The lead drug for this class of agents was camp- tothecin, which was discovered in the 1960s by Wani and Wall100 who isolated the material from Camptotheca acumi- nata, an ornamental tree found in China. Initial testing of the isolated material revealed promising antitumor activity, but testing in phase II trials gave disappointing results. The reason for this outcome was that camptothecin had low water solubil- ity, and to overcome this, the sodium salt had been prepared and used during the trials. This was accomplished by hydrol- ysis of the E-ring lactone to give the carboxylate salt (Scheme 10.28). The resulting ring-opened material was 10 times less active and more toxic producing inflammation of the small in- testines, blood in the urine, and myelosuppression.101,102 Interest in the material subsided until it was revealed that the mechanism of antitumor action was inhibition of topoiso- merase I.103 Subsequently, the incorporation of side chains containing basic amines led to the more water-soluble deriva- tives, topotecan and irinotecan (Fig. 10.16).104,105 These agents could be administered as the lactone giving better clin- ical results. Topoisomerase I produces single-strand breaks in DNA, utilizing a similar mechanism to topoisomerase II.106,107 The enzyme binds to supercoiled DNA and cleaves a single strand resulting in the formation of a cleavable complex with formation of a transient phosphodiester bond between DNA and a tyrosine residue of topoisomerase I. The comple- mentary strand of the double helix then passes through the break, and the enzyme then reseals the initial strand break. In this way, local supercoils are removed from DNA. The camp- tothecin analogs bind to the enzyme DNA complex after strand cleavage has occurred, such that the planar structure of the drug can intercalate between DNA base pairs and and then stabilize the cleavable complex. The binding site for this intercalation is only formed after the enzyme is bound to DNA, and once this site is occupied by the drug, it pre- vents the realignment necessary for resealing of the initial strand break. X-ray crystal structures have been solved for several camptothecin analogs bound to DNA and topoisomerase I.108 In the case of topotecan, the results indicate that the planar portion of the drug intercalates between base pairs at the DNA cleavage site. In this process, the 5�-OH of the cleaved strand is shifted away from the phosphotyrosine bond formed between the enzyme and DNA. This shift prevents the 5�-OH from attacking the phosphotyrosine bond and re- sealing the strands after supercoiling has been removed. The result is strand breakage. Other key interactions involve a di- rect hydrogen bond between Asp-533 of topoisomerase I and the 20-OH of topotecan. There is a water-bridged hydrogen bond between the lactone carbonyl at C-21of the drug and the phosphotyrosine of the covalent topoisomerase I-DNA adduct. An additional water-bridged hydrogen bond forms between Asn-722 and the pyridine carbonyl at C-16a of topotecan. Arg-364 is located in proximity to the quinoline nitrogen at N-1, although the interatomic distance was not close enough to allow for a specific interaction in the case of topotecan. Subsequent work with camptothecin, which binds with a slight twist of the planar ring system relative to topete- can, allowed for the formation of a hydrogen bond between Arg-364 and the N-1 nitrogen.109 The drugs orient such that C-7, C-9, and C-10 are directed into the major groove so that bulky substituents can be tolerated at these positions. These interactions are summarized in Figure 10.17.
