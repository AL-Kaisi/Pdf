the reactions of neighboring groups, isosteric replacement sometimes produces analogs that act as antagonists. The 6- NH2 and 6-OH groups appear to play essential roles in the hy- drogen-bonding interactions of base pairs during nucleic acid replication in cells (Fig. 2.28). Adenine, hypoxanthine and the antineoplastic 6-mercaptopurine illustrate how substitution of the significantly weaker hydrogen-bonding isosteric sulfhydryl groups results in a partial blockage of this interac- tion and a decrease in the rate of cellular synthesis. Similarly, replacement of the hydroxyl group of pteroylglutamic acid (folic acid) by the isosteric amino group and addition of the methyl group to the p-aminobenzoate leads to the widely used methotrexate, a folate antimetabolite. Replacement of the hydrogen at the 5-position of uracil with the isosteric flu- orine producing 5-fluorouracil blocks the methylation step leading to thymine. As a better understanding of the nature of the interac- tions between drug-metabolizing enzymes and biological receptors develops, selection of isosteric groups with particular electronic, solubility, and steric properties should permit the rational preparation of drugs that act more selectively. At the same time, results obtained by the systematic application of the principles of isosteric re- placement are aiding in the understanding of the nature of these receptors. Are There Drugs Developed Using the Newer Computer-Aided Drug Design Methods? The same question asked in the discussion of QSAR must be asked regarding the newer CADD methods. Are their com- mercial products that were discovered using these techniques? Here, the answer is yes. The example of dorzolamide is one. Others include the ACE-inhibitor captopril and HIV protease inhibitors nelfinavir and amprenavir. In reality, modern CADD is used in combination with structure-based drug de- sign and QSAR. These methods permit the medicinal chemist to focus more quickly on the structural components that en- hance activity and provide receptor specificity.49,50 SELECTED WEB PAGES The field of drug design, particularly those aspects that are computer intensive, is increasingly being featured on Web pages. Faculty and students might find it instructive to search the Web at regular intervals. Many university chem- istry departments have organized Web pages that provide excellent linkages. Listed are a small number of representa- tive sites that feature drug design linkages. Some have ex- cellent illustrations. These listings should not be considered any type of endorsement by the author, editors, or publisher.
