224� ALKALOIDS not more than 0.20% of reserpine-rescin- namine group alkaloids, calculated as re- serpine. PACKAGING AND STORAGE. Seasonal var- iation, genetic differences, geographic lo- cation, improper handling, improper drying, and other factors account for per- centage differences in alkaloid amount. Certain alkaloids hydrolyze easily, and proper storage of the roots, the powdered drug, and the compressed tablets must be observed. Rauwolfia serpentina should be packaged and stored in well-closed con- tainers in a cool, dry place that is secure against insect attack. USES AND DOSE. Rauwolfia serpentina is a hypotensive. (Reserpine is the chief al- kaloid and has strong hypotensive and sedative activity.) A total alkaloidal deter- mination is not indicative of activity unless the proportion of alkaloids is known. Because at least 50 alkaloids have been isolated, it is easy to understand the claim that the whole root exhibits a medicinal action that is different from that of reser- pine. A definite lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive states, a slowing of the pulse, and a general sense of euphoria fol- low administration In mild anxiety con- ditions, the drug has a transquilizing ef- fect. (The alkaloid has been described as a pheriotropic drug because it influences the function of the mind and the affective be- havior). The usual dose of rauwolfia ser- pentina is, initially, 200 to 400 mg daily given in 2 divided doses for I to 3 weeks; maintenance, 50 to 300 mg daily. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Powdered whole root in tablet form is represented by Raudixin, Rauval®, Wolfina®, and others. Alseroxylon fraction is a basic powdered alkaloidal extract of rauwolfia serpentina and is claimed to possess a lack of toxicity over long-range administration. It is given in doses of 2 mg, twice. daily. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Rauwiloj&. Reserpine is a white or pale buff to slightly yellow, odorless, crystalline pow- der that darkens slowly when exposed to light and rapidly when in solution. The structural formula is shown in Figure 8-16. USES AND DOSE. Reserpine is an antihy- pertensive and tranquilizer. The usual oral dose of reserpine is, initially, 500 p.g once a day for I to 2 weeks; maintenance, 100 to 250 g once a day. The patient should be advised to notify his physician if a change in mood occurs. PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. Sandrile, Ser- pasil, and other products. Reserpine has been obtained in com- mercial quantities from 4 different species of Rauvoifia; R. serpentina, R. micrantha Hooker filius, R. tetraphi/Ia Linné, and R. vornitoria Afzelius. Several of these present problems in the separation of the alkaloids. In R. 5cr peutma, reserpine and rescinna- mine both respond to the extraction pro- cedures, and the end result of the assay procedure is a mixture of both. In R. tet,n- pI1yfla, reserpine and deserpidine (raunor- mine) are extracted together; in R. vomito- rw, reserpine must be separated from the resins. Laboratory investigators in France have developed a method of synthesizing reser- pine on a commercial scale. However, the natural alkaloid is much less expensive than the synthetic, and, with large quan- tities of R. z'olnitaria available from the Congo, the commercial supplies appear to be sufficient to provide adequate amounts of reserpine and related alkaloids for many years to come. In addition, other species of plants are being studied to ascertain their alkaloidal composition. Because the family Apocynaceae consists of many ad- ditional species, it is probable that un- tapped sources of reserpine and other val- uable alkaloids may be discovered by pharmacognosists and plant chemists. Rescinnamjne is an alkaloid that occurs in several species of Rauvolfia. Its appear- ance, properties, and solubility are some- what similar to those of reserpine. Chem- ically, it is the methyl reserpate ester of 3,4,5-trimethoxy cinnamic acid; its struc- tural formula is shown on the next page.
