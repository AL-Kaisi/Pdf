alkylation has occurred. The binding of cisplatin- and carbo- platin-DNA adducts by the MMR enzymes results in in- creased cytotoxicity of these agents. Several rationales have been put forward as to why this occurs, including the in- volvement of MMR enzymes in downstream signaling that activates apoptosis. A second rationale involves the ability of MMR enzymes to remove replication errors that occur past the point of adduct formation, and in the process of re- moving these errors, gaps in the DNA are created, which lead to cell death. When there is a deficiency in the MMR enzymes, cells may be resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin because both of these agents produce the same DNA adduct. 364 Wilson and Gisvoldâ€™s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Scheme 10.8 Metabolic and chemical interactions of thiotepa with DNA.
