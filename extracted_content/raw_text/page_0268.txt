1Give 75 g of glucose dissolved in 300 mL of water after an overnight fast in persons who have been receiving at least 150–200 g of carbohydrate daily for 3 days before the test. 2A fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol) or HbA1c ≥6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes if confirmed by repeat testing. Symptoms and random glucose level >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) are diagnostic, and there is no need to do additional testing. TABLE 41–4 Diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Normal Glucose Tolerance, mg/dL (mMol/L) Prediabetes Diabetes Mellitus2 Fasting plasma glucose mg/dL (mmol/L) <100 (5.6) 100–125 (5.6–6.9) (impaired fasting glucose) ≥126 (7.0) Two hours after glucose load1 mg/dL (mmol/L) <140 (7.8) ≥140.199 (7.8–11.0) (impaired glucose tolerance) ≥200 (11.1) HbA1c (%) (ADA criteria) <5.7 5.7–6.4 ≥6.5 B . Hemoglobin A1c Measurements When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4–6% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose—referred to as hemoglobin1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red blood cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. The American Diabetes Association has endorsed the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic test for diabetes. A cutoff value of 6.5% was chosen because the risk of retinopathy increases substantially above this value. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7–6.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (see Table 41–4). C. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test If either the HbA1c level is less than 6.5% or the fasting plasma glucose level is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mMol/L) but diabetes is nonetheless suspected, then a standardized oral glucose tolerance test may be done (see Table 41–4). The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Patients should not smoke or be active during the test. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2­hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2­hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2­hour value of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance. D. Urine or Blood Ketones Qualitative detection of ketone bodies can be accomplished by nitroprusside tests (Acetest or Ketostix). Although these tests do not detect beta­
