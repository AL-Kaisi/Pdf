Calculated Conformations It should now be obvious that medicinal chemists must ob- tain an accurate understanding of the active conformation of the drug molecule. Originally, molecular models were con- structed from kits containing various atoms of different va- lence and oxidation states. Thus, there would be carbons suitable for carbon–carbon single, double, and triple bonds; carbon–oxygen bonds for alcohols or ethers and the car- bonyl moiety; carbon–nitrogen bonds for amines, amides, imines, and nitrites; and carbons for three-, four-, five-, and larger-member rings. More complete sets include various heteroatoms including nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur in vari- ous oxidation states. These kits might be ball and stick, stick or wire only, or space filling. The latter contained attempts at realistically visualizing the effect of a larger atom such as sulfur relative to the smaller oxygen. The diameters of the atoms in these kits are proportional to the van der Waals radii, usually corrected for overlap effects. In contrast, the wire models usually depict accurate intra-atomic distances between atoms. A skilled chemist using these kits usually can obtain a reasonably accurate 3D representation. This is particularly true if it is a moderately simple molecule with considerable rigidity. An extreme example is a steroid with the relatively inflexible fused-ring system. In contrast, mol- ecules with chains consisting of several atoms can assume many shapes. Yet, there will be a best shape or conforma- tion that can be expected to fit onto the receptor. The num- ber of conformers can be estimated from Equation 2.17. Calculating the global minimum, the lowest-energy confor- mation, can be a difficult computational problem. Assume that there are three carbon–carbon freely rotatable single bonds that are rotated in 10-degree increments. Equation 2.17 states that there are 46,656 different conformations. Number of conformers � ( ) No. rotatable bonds (Eq. 2.17) There are three common quantitative ways to obtain esti- mations of preferred molecular shapes required for a good 360 angle increment fit at the receptor. The first, which is the oldest and consid- ered the most accurate, is x-ray crystallography. When prop- erly done, resolution down to a few angstrom units can be obtained. This permits an accurate mathematical description of the molecule, providing atomic coordinates in 3D space that can be drawn by using a chemical graphics program. A serious limitation of this technique is the requirement for a carefully grown crystal. Some chemicals will not form crys- tals. Others form crystals with mixed symmetries. Nevertheless, with the newer computational techniques, in- cluding high-speed computers, large databases of x-ray crystallographic data are now available. These databases can be searched for structures, including substructures, sim- ilar to the molecule of interest. Depending on how close is the match, it is possible to obtain a pretty good idea of the low-energy conformation of the drug molecule. This is a common procedure for proteins and nucleic acids after obtaining the amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respec- tively. Obtaining these sequences is now largely an auto- mated process. There also is the debate that asks if the conformation found in the crystal represents the conformation seen by the receptor. For rigid molecules, it probably is. The question is very difficult to answer for flexible molecules. A common technique is to determine the crystal structure of a protein accurately and then soak the crystal in a nonaqueous solu- tion of the drug. This allows the drug molecules to diffuse into the active site. The resulting crystal is reanalyzed using different techniques, and the bound conformation of the drug can be determined rapidly without redoing the entire protein. Often, the structure of a bound drug can be deter- mined in a day or less. Because of the drawbacks to x-ray crystallography, two purely computational methods that require only a knowl- edge of the molecular structure are used. The two ap- proaches are known as quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics. Both are based on assumptions that (a) a mole- cule’s 3D geometry is a function of the forces acting on the molecule and (b) these forces can be expressed by a set of equations that pertain to all molecules. For the most part, both computational techniques assume that the molecule is in an isolated system. Solvation effects from water, which are common to any biological system, tend to be ignored, al- though this is changing with increased computational power. Calculations now can include limited numbers of water molecules, where the number depends on the amount of available computer time. Interestingly, many crystals grown for x-ray analysis can contain water in the crystal lat- tice. High-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides another means of obtaining the structures of macromolecules and drugs in solution. There are fundamental differences between the quantum and molecular mechanics approaches, and they illustrate the dilemma that can confront the medicinal chemist. Quantum mechanics is derived from basic theoretical principles at the atomic level. The model itself is exact, but the equations used in the technique are only approximate. The molecular properties are derived from the electronic structure of the molecule. The assumption is made that the distribution of electrons within a molecule can be described by a linear sum of functions that represent an atomic orbital.
