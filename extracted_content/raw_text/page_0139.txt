200� AIKAWIDS Duboisia myoporoides R. Brown (Fam. So!- anaceae), a large shrub indigenous to Aus- tralia. The drug contains (- )-hyoscy- amine, scopolamine, and a number of related alkaloids, in addition to small amounts of nicotine and nornicotine. Du- boisia currently is a chief source of atro- pine, the racemic mixture of the isomers of hyoscyamine, which is formed during the extraction process. The leaves of D. lei- chardlii F. von Mueller, of Australia, also contain a relatively large percentage of sim- ilar alkaloids. Pituri or Australian tobacco is the leaf of D. hopwoodii F. von Mueller and is used in Australia like tobacco. It contains nicotine and nornicotine. Mandragora or European mandrake is the root of Mandragora officinarum Linné and contains hyoscyamine, scopolaminc and mandragorine. This drug and its method of collection are the subjects of many superstitions and forkiore tales. It should not be confused with the resin-con- taining American mandrake (podophyl- !um); see page 141. Cocaine Coca or coca leaves have been described as the dried leaves of Eri,'throxylum coca La- marck, known commercially as Huanuco coca, or of E. truxillensc Rusby, known commercially as Truxillo coca (Earn. Ery- throxylaceac). The plants are shrubs or small trees that attain a height of about 2 meters and are indigenous to certain areas of South America. They have been culti- vated there for centuries but were later in- troduced as crops on the islands of Java and Ceylon. Erythroxylum is from 2 Greek words meaning red and wood, alluding to the color of the plants; coca is the Spanish name for the tree; and truxillense is from Truxillo, a coastal city in Peru. Modern studies have revealed that many of the old concepts regarding this drug were inaccurate. It is now generally rec- ognized that all of these plants character- ized by relatively high concentrations of ecgonine bases belong to one polymorphic species, En,throxylum coca Lamarck. Three varieties yielding the commercial drug may be distinguished: 1. var. coca (= E. coca Lamarck sensu stricto), yields Huanuco (Bolivian) coca. The leaves of commerce are large, dark green, and coriaceous with an acute or obtuse apex. 2. var. spructnnum Bruck ( = E. truxillense Rusby) yields Truxillo (Peruvian) coca. In commerce, these leaves are smaller, narrower, thinner, and lighter green than those of the var. coca. 3 var. novograna tense (Morris) Heron yields a type of Truxillo coca from Colombia. It rarely occurs in com- merce but may be distinguished from the previous varieties by its obtuse to emarginate apex. Most of the present-day supply of the drug is obtained from cultivated plants grown at an altitude of 500 to 2000 meters in Peru and Boliva. According to estimates, Bolivia and Peru each produces about 50,000 metric tons of leaves a year. About 25% of the harvest is consumed by the in- digenous population who chew the coca leaves. Approximately 2% is exported in legitimate commerce for the manufacture of pharmaceutic cocaine, with nearly 250,000 kg of coca leaves being imported into the United States from Peru annually. About 75,000 metric tons of leaves remain available for the production of illicit sub- stances. In the processing of the leaves to cocaine, the farmers themselves often engage in the first steps by turning the leaves into coca paste which is easier to transport to a co- caine processing laboratory. More than 100 kg of dried leaves are needed to make a single kilogram of paste. The leaves are col- lected from twigs that are cut off in the spring, pruned again in June, and pruned for a third time in the fall. The dried, crushed leaves are mixed with water and
