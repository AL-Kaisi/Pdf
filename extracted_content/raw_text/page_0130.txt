ALKALOIDS� 191 The mixture is used as a stimulant masti- catorv in India and the Fast Indies. In India, the mixture is known as 'punsu- pan." Betel chewing has been practiced since early times: The natives chew fresh betel nuts; dried betel nuts are used for pharmaceutic purposes. The value of areca as a taenicide apparently has been known in the East for a long time but was not known to western civilization until 1863. Areca contains several alkaloids that are reduced pyridine derivatives. Among them are arecoline (arecaidine methyl ester), arecaidine (N-methyl guvacine), gu- vacine (tetrahydronicotinic acid), and gu- vacoline (guvacine meth yl ester). The total alkaloid content can reach 0.45%. Areco- line, the most abundant and physiologi- cally most active alkaloid, is a liquid oc- curring to the extent of about 0 2 1/,. Areca also contains tannin (about 15 17c), lipids volatile oils, and gum. USE AND DOSE. Areca is classified as an anthelmintic in veterinary practice and is employed as a vermicide and taenifuge. The usual dose in dogs is 2 to 4 g; in sheep, 4 to 8 g, based on the weight of the anftnal. -CO -OCH, :1� Br H� CH Arecoline Hydrobrornde Lobelia Lobelia or Indian tobacco consists of the dried leaves and tops of Lobelia inflata LinnC (Fam. Lobeliaceae). Lobelia was named in honor of Matthias de L'Obe!, a Flemish bot- anist (1538 to 1616); inflata refers to the fruit, which is hollow and distended. The plant is an annual herb indigenous to the eastern and central United States and to Canada. Commercial supplies come from collect- ing stations in North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. it should be collected after a portion of the capsules has become in- flated; then it should be carefully dried and preserved. Lobelia was employed by the Indians, when necessity required, as a sub- stitute for tobacco, its emetic properties were first observed in 1785, and the drug was introduced into medicine in 1807. The drug contains 14 alkaloids, of which lobeline is the major and most important, a pungent volatile oil, resin, lipids, and gum. Lobeline, (— )-Iobeline, or alpha lobe- line (to distinguish it from a mixture of the lobelia alkaloids formerly designated as lobeline) occurs as colorless crystals that are slightly soluble in water but readily sol- uble in hot alcohol. 0� OH (- )-Lobeline USES AND DOSE. Loheline produces sim- ilar, but weaker, pharmacologic effects to those of nicotine on the peripheral circu- lation, neuromuscular junctions, and the central nervous system. For this reason, a 2.0-mg dose of loheline sulfate is incorpo- rated in tablets or lozenges that are in- tended to aid in breaking the tobacco habit (smoking deterrents). The majority of con- trolled studies show that lobeline has only a placebo effect on decreasing the physical craving for cigarettes. NONPRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Bantron5'. TROPANE ALKALOIDS Tropane is a dicyclic compound formed by the condensation of a pyrrolidine pre- cursor (ornithine) with 3 acetate-derived carbon atoms. Both pyrrolidine and piper- idine ring systems can be discerned in the molecule. The 3-hydroxv derivative of tropane is known as tropine. Its esterification with (—)-tropic acid yields hyoscyamine (tro- pine tropate), which may be racemized to form atropine.
