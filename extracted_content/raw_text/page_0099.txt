101 Heart Failure | CHAPTER 9 FIGURE 9-1. Treatment of HFrEF Stages C and D. (Data from Heidenreich PA, Bozkurt B, Aguilar D, et al. 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the manage- ment of heart failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines. J Am Coll Cardiol 2022;79:e263–e421.) Step 1 Establish diagnosis of HFrEF Step 2 Titrate to target dosing as tolerated, labs, health status, and LVEF Step 3 Consider these patient scenarios Step 4 Implement additional GDMT and device therapy, as indicated Step 5 Reassess symptoms, labs, health status, and LVEF Refractory HF (Stage D) In select patients, durable MCS (1) Cardiac transplant (1) Palliative care (1) (can be initiated before Stage D) Investigational studies* Symptoms improved Step 6 Referral for HF specialty care for additional therapy Address congestion Initiate GDMT HFrEF LVEF ≤40% (Stage C) LVEF ≤40% Persistent HFrEF (Stage C) LVEF ≤40% HFimpEF (Stage C) ARNi in NYHA II-III; ACEi or ARB in NYHA II-IV (1) NYHA III-IV, in African American patients Hydral-nitrates (1) Consider additional therapies NYHA I-III; LVEF ≤35% >1y survival NYHA II-III; ambulatory IV; LVEF ≤35%; NSR and QRS ≥150 ms with LBBB Beta blocker (1) MRA (1) SGLT2i (1) Continue GDMT with serial reassessment and optimize dosing, adherence and patient education, address goals of care Diuretics as needed (1) ICD (1) CRT-D (1) • The most common adverse effects include hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia. A dry, nonproductive cough (occurring in 15%–20% of patients) is the most common reason for discontinuation. Because cough is a bradykinin-mediated effect, replacement with sacubitril/valsartan or an ARB is reasonable; however,
