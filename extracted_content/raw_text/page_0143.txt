Cinchona Cinchona, cinchona bark, or Peruvian bark is the dried bark of the stem or of the root of Cinchona succirubra Pavorl et Klotzsch (Fig. 8-11), or its hybrids, known in commerce as red cinchona; or of C. ledg- eriana (Howard) Moens et Trirnen, C. cali- saya Weddell, or hybrids of these with other species of Cinchona, known in com- merce as calisaya bark or yellow cinchona (Fam. Rubiaceae). Cinchona was named in honor of the Countess of Chinchon, wife of the Viceroy of Peru; succirubra is Latin and means red juice; calisaya is the Spanish and Indian name in Peru for the bark of a tree; led g- eriana is named in honor of Charles Ledger who introduced Cinchona into the East In- dies. The plants are trees indigenous to the Andes of Ecuador and Peru. They grow at an elevation of 1000 to 3000 meters and are cultivated in Indonesia and India. There are over 36 known species and hybrids of Cinchona. just before World War II, Java (Indone- sia) supplied over 90% of the world con- sumption of this important drug. When the Japanese cut off this supply from the world, several synthetic antimalarials (chioroquine, quinacrine, and primacrine) were developed to replace cinchona. Cul- tivation of cinchona trees was also under- taken in several countries in Central and South America (where it originally oc- curred). Alkaloid production from these trees during the early months of World War Ii was a deciding factor in preventing further advances by the Japanese in the Pacific area. Extraction techniques were improved in such a manner as to utilize all of the important alkaloids in any type of cinchona bark that could be obtained from any source. The Dutch have now resumed the man- ufacture of cinchona alkaloids using bark obtained from Indonesia. A certain amount of alkaloids is produced in Germany; owing to economic factors, practically none is produced in the United States, Cultivation gives the opportunity to se- lect seeds from plants producing high- quality bark and to hybridize one choice strain with another. Thus, hybrids of Cin- chona ledgeriana-Cinchona calisaya produce a higher yield of alkaloids than do either of the parent species. Selected seeds planted in seed beds develop into young plants that can be transplanted within 2 years. The stems tend to grow tall, the lower branches tend to die and drop off, and the tree crowns grow closely, thus shading the
