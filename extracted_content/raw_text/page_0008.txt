producing an estimated 3D shape. The model for the recep- tor becomes the template for designing new ligands. Genome mapping has greatly increased the information on receptors. Besides the human genome, the genetic composi- tion of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites has increased the possible sites for drugs to act. The new field of pro- teomics studies the proteins produced by structural genes. The earlier discussion in this chapter emphasizes that the cell membrane is a highly organized, dynamic structure that interacts with small molecules in specific ways; its focus is on the lipid bilayer component of this complex structure. The receptor components of the membranes appear to be mainly protein. They constitute a highly organized, inter- twined region of the cell membrane. The same type of mo- lecular specificity seen in such proteins as enzymes and antibodies is also a property of drug receptors. The nature of the amide link in proteins provides a unique opportunity for the formation of multiple internal hydrogen bonds, as well as internal formation of hydrophobic, van der Waals, and ionic bonds by side chain groups, leading to such organized structures as the �-helix, which contains about four amino acid residues for each turn of the helix. An organized pro- tein structure would hold the amino acid side chains at rel- atively fixed positions in space and available for specific interactions with a small molecule. Proteins can potentially adopt many different conforma- tions in space without breaking their covalent amide linkages. They may shift from highly coiled structures to par- tially disorganized structures, with parts of the molecule ex- isting in random chain or folded sheet structures, contingent on the environment. In the monolayer of a cell membrane, the interaction of a small foreign molecule with an organized protein may lead to a significant change in the structural and physical properties of the membrane. Such changes could well be the initiating events in the tissue or organ response to a drug, such as the ion-translocation effects produced by in- teraction of acetylcholine and the cholinergic receptor. The large body of information now available on relation- ships between chemical structure and biological activity strongly supports the concept of flexible receptors. The fit of drugs onto or into macromolecules is rarely an all-or-none process as pictured by the earlier lock-and-key concept of a receptor. Rather, the binding or partial insertion of groups of moderate size onto or into a macromolecular pouch appears to be a continuous process, at least over a limited range, as indicated by the frequently occurring regular increase and decrease in biological activity as one ascends a homologous series of drugs. A range of productive associations between drug and receptor may be pictured, which leads to agonist responses, such as those produced by cholinergic and adren- ergic drugs. Similarly, strong associations may lead to unproductive changes in the configuration of the macromol- ecule, leading to an antagonistic or blocking response, such as that produced by anticholinergic agents and HIV protease inhibitors. Although the fundamental structural unit of the drug receptor is generally considered to be protein, it may be supplemented by its associations with other units, such as mucopolysaccharides and nucleic acids. Humans (and mammals in general) are very complex or- ganisms that have developed specialized organ systems. It is not surprising that receptors are not distributed equally throughout the body. It now is realized that, depending on the organ in which it is located, the same receptor class may be- have differently. This can be advantageous by focusing drug therapy on a specific organ system, but it can also cause adverse drug responses because the drug is exerting two dif- ferent responses based on the location of the receptors. An ex- ample is the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). They cannot be classified simply as agonists or antagonists. Rather, they can be considered variable agonists and antago- nists. Their selectivity is very complex because it depends on the organ in which the receptor is located. This complexity can be illustrated with tamoxifen and raloxifene (Fig. 2.2). Tamoxifen is used for estrogen-sensitive breast cancer and for reducing bone loss from osteoporosis. Unfortunately, prolonged treatment increases the risk of en- dometrial cancer because of the response from the uterine es- trogen receptors. Thus, tamoxifen is an estrogen antagonist in the mammary gland and an agonist in the uterus and bone. In contrast, raloxifene does not appear to have much agonist property in the uterus but, like tamoxifen, is an antagonist in the breast and agonist in the bone. 10 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Figure 2.2 Selective SERMs.
