Plasma concentration of a drug given intrave­ nously (top) and orally (bottom) on a fixed dose of 50 mg and fixed dosing interval of 8 hours. The half-life is 12 hours. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosing inter­ val at steady state is equal to the total AUC for a single dose. The fluctuation of the concentration is diminished for oral administra­ tion (half-life of absorption is 1.4 hours), but the average steady­ state concentration is the same as after intravenous administration, because f = 1.

Frequently, drugs are administered one to four times per day, most often in a fixed dose, for example, 75 mg three times daily after meals. As mentioned earlier, after a drug is administered, its level within the body varies because of the influence of all of the processes, ADME. A drug will accumulate in the body when the dosing interval is less than the time needed for the body to eliminate a single dose. Figure 5.17 illustrates the plasma concentra­ tion for a drug given by intravenous administration and oral administration. The 50-mg dose of this drug was given at a dosing interval of 8 hours. The drug has an elimination half-life of 12 hours. As one can see, with continued dos­ ing, the drug concentration reaches a steady-state or pla­ teau concentration. At this limit, the amount of drug lost per interval is replenished when the drug is dosed again. Consequently, the concentration of drug in the plasma or serum fluctuates. Thus, for certain patient types, it is optimal to target dosing so that the plateau concentration resides within the therapeutic index of a drug to maintain an MEC. For example, the asthmatic patient maintained on theophylline must have a serum concentration between 10 and 20 mg/mL. Otherwise, the patient may be susceptible to an asthma attack. Thus, when dosing the asthmatic patient, it is preferable to give theophylline around the clock four times daily to sustain levels at least above the MEC. If this medicine is administered only every 4 hours during the waking hours, it is possible that the minimum concentration will fall below effective levels between the bedtime dose and the morning dose. Consequently, the patient may awaken in the middle of the night and have an asthma attack. Patients can be monitored pharmacokinetically through appropriate plasma, serum, or blood samples, and some hospital pharmacies have implemented pharmacokinetic dosing services. The intent is to maximize drug efficacy, minimize toxicity, and keep health care costs at a mini­ mum. Thus, complications associated with overdose are controlled, and known drug interactions, such as between smoking and theophylline, can be accommodated. In these services, once the physician prescribes a certain amount of drug and monitors the clinical response, it is the pharmacist who coordinates the appropriate sample time to determine drug concentration in the appropriate body fluid. After the level of drug is attained, it is the pharmacist who interprets the result and consults with the physician regarding subsequent dosages. Pharmacokinetic research has demonstrated that the determination of a patient's dosage regimen depends on numerous factors, and daily dose formulas exist for a num­ ber of drugs that must be administered on a routine main­ tenance schedule, for example, digoxin, procainamide, and theophylline. For certain drugs such as digoxin, which are not highly lipid soluble, it is preferable to use a patient's lean body weight (LBW) rather than total body weight (TBW) to provide a better estimate of the patient's volume of distribution. On the other hand, estimating a patient's CrCL for initial vancomycin dosing uses TBW according to Equation 5.13: CrCL (male) mL/min= (140-age)xTBW(kg) Equation 5.13 72xScr CrCL (female) mL/min = [0.SS] (140-age)xTBW(kg) 72 xScr Equation 5.14 Subsequent doses then must be calculated based on obtaining a trough vancomycin level 30 minutes before the next scheduled dose. In addition, the dosing inter­ val (in hours) is based upon the patient's calculated CrCL (9).
