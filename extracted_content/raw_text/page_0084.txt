metaphase anaphase boundary, and cells undergo apopto- sis.133 Paclitaxel has also been shown to enhance phospho- rylation of a serine residue of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein resulting in inhibition of Bcl-2�s ability to block apoptosis. The proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bax are stimulated and in a similar manner, docetaxel has been shown to induce apoptosis by activation of caspase enzymes.134 Resistance to the taxanes is like that seen for the vinca al- kaloids and other agents and involves Pgp-mediated efflux. Alterations in the structure of �-tubulin may also occur and result in decreased binding of taxanes to the microtubules and therefore reduced cytotoxicity. PACLITAXEL (TAX, TAXOL) Paclitaxel is available in single-dose vials of 30 mg/5 mL and 100 mg/16.7 mL for IV administration in the treatment of breast, ovarian, NSCLC, and AIDS-related Kaposi sar- coma. Other uses have included treatment of head, neck, esophageal, cervical, prostate, and bladder cancers. Paclitaxel is highly plasma protein bound (�90%) and does not penetrate the CNS. Metabolism involves CYP- mediated oxidation to give 6�-hydroxypaclitaxel (CYP2C8) and para hydroxylation of the phenyl group attached to the 3�-position (CYP3A4). The 6�-hydroxy metabolite nor- mally predominates, but the para hydroxy metabolite may occur to a greater degree in those patients with liver disease or when CYP3A4 has been induced. Both metabolites are less active than the parent and do not undergo phase II con- jugation reactions. Elimination occurs primarily in the feces, and the elimination half-life is 9 to 50 hours depending on the infusion period. The major toxicity seen with paclitaxel is a dose-limiting myelosuppression that normally presents as neutropenia. The previously mentioned hypersensitivity reactions occur but are greatly reduced by antihistamine pretreatment. Interaction with the axonal microtubules such as that seen for the vincas also occurs and leads to numbness and paresthesias (abnor- mal touch sensations including burning and prickling). The agent is also available as an albumin-bound formulation (Abraxane) to eliminate the need for the solubilizing agents associated with the hypersensitivity reactions. Other adverse effects include bradycardia, which may progress to heart block, alopecia, mucositis, and/or diarrhea. Paclitaxel pro- duces moderate nausea and vomiting that is short-lived. DOCETAXEL (TXT, TAXOTERE) Docetaxel is available in single-dose vials of 20 mg/0.5 mL and 80 mg/2 mL for IV administration in the treatment of breast, NSCLC, and prostate cancers. It has also been uti- lized in non–FDA-approved treatment of head, neck, gas- tric, bladder, and refractory ovarian cancers. Docetaxel is highly plasma protein bound (80%) and widely distributed with the highest concentration in the he- patobiliary system, but it does not appear to cross the blood- brain barrier. The metabolism of docetaxel has been less well studied than that of paclitaxel. The use of human liver microsomes has indicated that metabolism involves oxida- tion of one of the tert-butyl methyl groups of the C-13 side chain to initially give the alcohol. Further oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid both of which may cyclize with the carbamate nitrogen to give stereoisomeric hydrox- yoxazolidinones and an oxazolidinedione, respectively. No active metabolites have been identified. The major enzyme involved is CYP3A4. The drug is primarily eliminated in the feces with a terminal half-life of 11 hours. The adverse effects profile for docetaxel is similar to that of paclitaxel but also includes reversible fluid retention that is dose related. This has been associated with an initial increase in capillary permeability followed by a decrease in lymphatic drainage later in the therapy. Restriction of sodium intake and pretreatment with corticosteroids is usually successful in minimizing this adverse effect. Peripheral neuropathy is seen with docetaxel but occurs less often than with paclitaxel. Fatigue and muscle pain are commonly seen, and fever may occur in up to 30% of patients who are infection free. IXABEPILONE (AZAEPOTHILONE B, IXEMPRA) The epothilones are macrocyclic lactones that have a mech- anism of action similar to that of the taxanes but offer sev- eral advantages (Fig. 10.23).135 Ixabepilone is the semisyn- thetic amide analog of epothilone B that is isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum. The epothilones showed potent in vitro activity but greatly decreased activ- ity in vivo caused by metabolic instability via hydrolysis of the macrocyclic lactone. Conversion to the lactam increased stability and maintained in vivo activity. Ixabepilone has been recently (2007) approved for the treatment of metasta- tic breast cancer that is resistant to the taxanes. The agent is believed to bind to the same site occupied by the taxanes. Molecular modeling studies have been utilized to identify a common pharmacophore between the taxanes and epothilones.136 Key structural components that assume comparable relative position are indicated in Table 10.2. Like the taxanes, ixabepilone binds to �-tubulin and stabi- lizes microtubules resulting in cell death. The agent is use- ful in cancers that have become resistant to the taxanes, be- cause it is not removed by Pgp and is still capable of binding Chapter 10 Antineoplastic Agents 399 Figure 10.23 Structures of epithilones.
