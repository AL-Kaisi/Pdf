administration and necessitating direct injection into the tumor. In cases of extravasation (drug escapes from the tumor into the underlying tissue), the antidote sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), a strong nucleophile, may be administered. It is capable of reacting with electrophilic sites on the mustard, and once reaction has occurred, the resulting adduct has increased water solubility and may be readily eliminated (Scheme 10.4). Cancer patients are at an increased risk of extravasation be- cause of the fragility of their veins resulting from radiation, previous chemotherapy treatments, or malnutrition. The lack of selectivity of mechlorethamine led to attempts to improve on the agent. One rationale was to reduce the re- activity by reducing the nucleophilicity of nitrogen, thereby slowing aziridinium cation formation. This could be accom- plished by replacement of the weakly electron-donating methyl group with groups that were electron withdrawing (-I). This is seen in the case of chlorambucil and melphalan by attachment of nitrogen to a phenyl ring (Fig. 10.3).7 Reactivity was reduced such that these compounds could be administered orally. In the case of melphalan, attachment of the mustard functionality to a phenylalanine moiety was not only an attempt to reduce reactivity but also an attempt to increase entry into cancer cells by utilization of carrier- mediated uptake.8 Melphalan was found to utilize active transport to gain entry into cells, but selective uptake by cancer cells has not been demonstrated. 9 Attachment of more highly electron-withdrawing func- tionalities was utilized in the case of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide (Fig. 10.4). In these cases, aziridinium cation formation is not possible until the electron-withdrawing function has been altered. In the case of cyclophosphamide, it was initially believed that the drug could be selectively activated in cancer cells because they were believed to con- tain high levels of phosphoramidase enzymes. This would remove the electron-withdrawing phosphoryl function and allow aziridine formation to occur. However, it turned out that the drug was activated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5 to give a carbinolamine that could undergo ring opening to give the aldehyde.10,11 The increased acidity of the aldehyde �-hydrogen facili- tates a retro-Michael decomposition (Scheme 10.5). The ionized phosphoramide is now electron-releasing via induction and allows aziridinium cation formation to pro- ceed. Acrolein is also formed as a result of this process, which may itself act as an electrophile that has been asso- ciated with bladder toxicity. Alternatively, the agent may be inactivated by alcohol dehydrogenase–mediated oxida- tion of the carbinolamine to give the amide or by further oxidation of the aldehyde intermediate to give the acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. To decrease the incidence of kidney and bladder toxicity, the sulfhydryl (MSH) containing agent mesna may be admin- istered and functions to react with the electrophilic species that may be present in the kidney. The sulfonic acid function- ality serves to help concentrate the material in the urine, and the nucleophilic sulfhydryl group may react with the carbinol- amine, aziridinium cation, the chloro substituents of cy- clophosphamide, or via conjugate addition with acrolein (Scheme 10.6). This inactivation and detoxification may also be accomplished by other thiol-containing proteins such as 360 Wilson and Gisvold’s Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry Scheme 10.4 Thiosulfate inactivation of mechlorethamine.
