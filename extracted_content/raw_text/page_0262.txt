Schematic diagram of the insulin receptor heterodimer in the activated state. IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MAP, mitogen­activated protein; P, phosphate; Tyr, tyrosine. The first proteins to be phosphorylated by the activated receptor tyrosine kinases are the docking proteins: insulin receptor substrates (IRS). After tyrosine phosphorylation at several critical sites, the IRS molecules bind to and activate other kinases subserving energy metabolism—most significantly phosphatidylinositol­3­kinase—which produce further phosphorylations. Alternatively, they may stimulate a mitogenic pathway and bind to an adaptor protein such as growth factor receptor–binding protein 2, which translates the insulin signal to a guanine nucleotide­releasing factor that ultimately activates the GTP binding protein, Ras, and the mitogen­activated protein kinase (MAPK) system. The particular IRS­phosphorylated tyrosine kinases have binding specificity with downstream molecules based on their surrounding 4–5 amino acid sequences or motifs that recognize specific Src homology 2 (SH2) domains on the other protein. This network of phosphorylations within the cell represents insulin’s second message and results in multiple effects, including translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT 4, Table 41–2) to the cell membrane with a resultant increase in glucose uptake; increased glycogen synthase activity and increased glycogen formation; multiple effects on protein synthesis, lipolysis, and lipogenesis; and activation of transcription factors that enhance DNA synthesis and cell growth and division.
