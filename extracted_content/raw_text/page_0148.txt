ALKALOIDS� 209 soquinoline intermediates. For this reason, opium is included in this group. Sangui- naria, another member of the Papavera- ceae, also contains isoquinoline alkaloids. The important drugs and their alkaloids in this group are ipecac, emetine, hydras- tis, hydrastine, sanguinaria, curare, tubo- curarine, berberirie, and opium and its al- kaloids. codeine and then to the potent narcotic morphine. P. sonimferu,n has a highly evolved and useful secondary metabolism that culmi- nates, at least from the therapeutic view- point, in morphine. P. bracteatum Lindley, a thebaine-producing poppy, appears to lack any significant demethylation capa- bility; this feature is not only useful for bio- synthetic studies but has recently become commercially significant. Because thebaine can be converted to codeine semisynthet- ically, a source of the latter alkaloid is as- sured without concomitant production of morphine, which is more subject to abuse by drug addicts. These 2 species emphasize the subtle metabolic difference that fre- quently separates useful'piits from those of only scientific interest. Presumably, morphine and other opium alkaloids are formed primarily in various cells of the poppy plant and are excreted into the laticiferous ducts. However, iso- lated latex is capable of alkaloid biosyn- thesis in the presence of suitable precur- sors and cofactors. The latex is also capable of metabolic destruction of morphine, and diurnal variations in alkaloid compositioi of the latex have been recorded. These ob Servattons, which establish ,i metaboJi function for the latex, are fundamentally significant and undoubtedly contribute to the normal variability in alkaloid compo- sition of crude opium samples. Ipecac Ipecac consists of the dried rhizome and roots of Cephaclis ipc'cncuanha (Brotero) A. Richard, known in commerce as Rio or Bra- zilian ipecac, or of Cephaclis acu,niiiafn Kar- sten,' known in commerce as Cartagena, Nicaragua, or Panama ipecac (Farm Rubi- aceae). Ipecac yields not less than 2% of the ether-soluble alkaloids of ipecac. Cephaclis is from 2 Greek words, meaning head and to collect or roll up, and refers to the inflorescence; ipi'cacuanha is Portu- guese from the Brazilian Indian ipekan- 'ue.ne, meaning a creeping plant that Biosynthesis of Isoquinoline Alkaloids Although the isoquinolirie alkaloids pos- sess relatively complex structures, the basic biosynthetic reactions that account for their formation in plants are relatively simple. These compounds result from the condensation of a phenylethylamine deriv- ative with a phenylacetaldehyde deriva- tive. Both of these moieties are derived from phenylalanine or tyrosine. Adminis- tration of tyrusine-2- 11C to Papaver soinnif- erurn resulted in the formation of papas'- erine labeled in corresponding positions. Norlaudanosoline is an intermediate in this reaction (Fig. 8-42). Morphine is also formed from 2 mole- cules of tyrosine, and its biosynthesis is related to the biosynthesis of papaverine. Norlaudanosoline serves as a key inter- mediate. This medicinally important alka- loid is derived from a benzylisoquinoline metabolite. The biosynthesis of morphine and related alkaloids has been studied ex- tensively, and these experiments provide some of the most complete and detailed observations available for any secondary plant constituent. The biosynthetic path- way leading to morphine is shown in Fig- ure 8-12. A key feature of this pathway is the enzymatically controlled methylation pattern that gives rise to (— )-reticuline, thus facilitating formation of the dienone, salutaridine, which is the first intermediate with a phenanthrene nucleus. Another in- teresting aspect of this pathway is the bio- synthetic relationship of thebaine, codeine, and morphine; stepwise demethylation of the therapeuticall y unimportant thebainc leads first to the relatively mild analgesic
